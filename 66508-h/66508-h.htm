<h2><a name="BOOK_XII" id="BOOK_XII"></a>BOOK XII.</h2>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">You</span> appear to me, my good friend Timocrates, to be a man of Cyrene,
according to the Tyndareus of Alexis&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">For there if any man invites another</div>
    <div class="verse">To any banquet, eighteen others come;</div>
    <div class="verse">Ten chariots, and fifteen pairs of horses,</div>
    <div class="verse">And for all these you must provide the food,</div>
    <div class="verse">So that 'twere better to invite nobody</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And it would be better for me also to hold my tongue, and not to add
anything more to all that has been said already; but since you ask me
very earnestly for a discussion on those men who have been notorious
for luxury, and on their effeminate practices, you must be gratified.</p>

<p>2. For enjoyment is connected, in the first instance, with appetite;
and in the second place, with pleasure. And Sophocles the poet, being a
man fond of enjoyment, in order to avoid accusing old age, attributed
his impotence in amatory pleasures to his temperance, saying that he
was glad to be released from them as from some hard master. But I
say that the Judgment of Paris is a tale originally invented by the
ancients, as a comparison between pleasure and virtue. Accordingly,
when Venus, that is to say pleasure, was preferred, everything was
thrown into confusion. And that excellent writer Xenophon seems to
me to have invented his fable about Hercules and Virtue on the same
principle. For according to Empedocles&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Mars was no god to them, nor gallant War,</div>
    <div class="verse">Nor Jupiter the king, nor Saturn old,</div>
    <div class="verse">Nor Neptune; Venus was their only queen.</div>
    <div class="verse">Her they propitiate and duly worship</div>
    <div class="verse">With pious images, with beauteous figures</div>
    <div class="verse">Skilfully carved; with fragrant incenses,</div>
    <div class="verse">And holy offerings of unmix'd myrrh,</div>
    <div class="verse">And sweetly-smelling frankincense; and many</div>
    <div class="verse">A pure libation of fresh golden honey</div>
    <div class="verse">They pour'd along the floor.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 819]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">LOVE OF PLEASURE.</div>

<p>And Menander, in his Harp-player, speaking of some one who was very
fond of music, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">He was to music much devoted, and</div>
    <div class="verse">Sought ever pleasing sounds to gratify</div>
    <div class="verse">His delicate taste.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>3. And yet some people say that the desire of pleasure is a natural
desire, as may be proved by all animals becoming enslaved by it; as
if cowardice, and fear, and all sorts of other passions were not also
common to all animals, and yet these are rejected by all who use their
reason. Accordingly, to be very eager in the pursuit of pleasure is
to go hunting for pain. On which account Homer, wishing to represent
pleasure in an odious light, says that the greatest of the gods receive
no advantage from their power, but are even much injured by it, if they
will allow themselves to be hurried away by the pursuit of pleasure.
For all the anxiety which Jupiter, when awake, lavished on the Trojans,
was lost in open day, when he abandoned himself to pleasure. And Mars,
who was a most valiant deity, was put in chains by Vulcan, who was very
powerless, and incurred great disgrace and punishment, when he had
given himself up to irrational love; and therefore he says to the Gods,
when they came to see him in fetters&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse">Yet Vulcan conquers, and the God of arms</div>
    <div class="verse">Must pay the penalty for lawless charms.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></div>
   </div>

 </div>
</div>

<p>But no one ever calls the life of Aristides a life of pleasure (ἡδὺς),
but that is an epithet they apply to
Smindyrides the Sybarite, and to Sardanapalus, though as far as glory
went, as Theophrastus says in his book on Pleasure, it was a far more
splendid one; but Aristides never devoted himself to luxury as those
other men did. Nor would any one call the life of Agesilaus the king
of the Lacedæmonians ἡδὺς; but this
name they would apply rather to the life of Ananis, a man who, as far
as real glory is concerned, is totally unknown. Nor would one call the
life of the heroes who fought

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 820]</span>

against Troy ἡδὺς; but they would speak in that way much more
of the men of the present time; and naturally enough. For the lives
of those men were destitute of any luxurious preparation, and, as I
might almost say, had no seasoning to them, inasmuch as at that time
there was no commercial intercourse between nations, nor were the arts
of refinement carried to any degree of accuracy; but the life of men
of the present day is planned with entire reference to laziness, and
enjoyment, and to all sorts of pastimes.</p>

<p>4. But Plato, in his Philebus, says&mdash;"Pleasure is the most insolent of
all things; and, as it is reported, in amatory enjoyments, which are
said to be the most powerful of all, even perjury has been pardoned by
the Gods, as if pleasure was like a child, incapable of distinguishing
between right and wrong." And in the eighth book of his Polity, the
same Plato has previously dilated upon the doctrine so much pressed
by the Epicureans, that, of the desires, some are natural but not
necessary, and others neither natural nor necessary, writing thus&mdash;"Is
not the desire to eat enough for health and strength of body, and
for bread and meat to that extent, a necessary desire?&mdash;I think it
is.&mdash;At all events, the desire for food for these two purposes
is necessary, inasmuch as it is salutary, and inasmuch as it is able
to remove hunger?&mdash;No doubt.&mdash;And the desire for meat, too,
is a necessary desire, if it at all contributes to a good habit of
body?&mdash;Most undoubtedly.&mdash;What, then, are we to say? Is no
desire which goes beyond the appetite for this kind of food, and for
other food similar to it, and which, if it is checked in young people,
can be entirely stifled, and which is injurious also to the body, and
injurious also to the mind, both as far as its intellectual powers
are concerned, and also as to its temperance, entitled to be called a
necessary one?&mdash;Most certainly not."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 821]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">LOVE OF PLEASURE.</div>

<p>5. But Heraclides of Pontus, in his treatise on Pleasure, speaks as
follows&mdash;"Tyrants and kings, having all kinds of good things in
their power, and having had experience of all things, place pleasure
in the first rank, on the ground that pleasure makes the nature of man
more magnanimous. Accordingly, all those who have honoured pleasure
above everything, and who have deliberately chosen to live a life of
luxury,

have been and magnificent people, as, for instance, the Medes and the
Persians. For they, of all men, are those who hold pleasure and luxury
in the highest honour; and they, at the same time, are the most valiant
and magnanimous of all the barbarians. For to indulge in pleasure and
luxury is the conduct of freeborn men and of a liberal disposition. For
pleasure relaxes the soul and invigorates it. But labour belongs to
slaves and to mean men; on which account they are contracted in their
natural dispositions. And the city of the Athenians, while it indulged
in luxury, was a very great city, and bred very magnanimous men. For
they wore purple garments, and were clad in embroidered tunics; and
they bound up their hair in knots, and wore golden grasshoppers over
their foreheads and in their hair: and their slaves followed them,
bearing folding chairs for them, in order that, if they wished to sit
down, they might not be without some proper seat, and forced to put
up with any chance seat. And these men were such heroes, that they
conquered in the battle of Marathon, and they alone worsted the power
of combined Asia. And all those who are the wisest of men, and who have
the greatest reputation for wisdom, think pleasure the greatest good.
Simonides certainly does when he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">For what kind of human life</div>
    <div class="verse">Can be worth desiring,</div>
    <div class="verse">If pleasure be denied to it?</div>
    <div class="verse">What kingly power even?</div>
    <div class="verse">Without pleasure e'en the gods</div>
    <div class="verse">Have nothing to be envied for.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>


<p>And Pindar, giving advice to Hiero the tyrant of Syracuse, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Never obscure fair pleasure in your life;</div>
    <div class="verse">A life of pleasure is the best for man.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>


<p>And Homer, too, speaks of pleasure and indulgence in the following
terms&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">How sweet the products of a peaceful reign,&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse">The heaven-taught poet and enchanting strain,</div>
    <div class="verse">The well-fill'd palace, the perpetual feast,</div>
    <div class="verse">A loud rejoicing, and a people blest!</div>
    <div class="verse">How goodly seems it ever to employ</div>
    <div class="verse">Man's social days in union and in joy;</div>
    <div class="verse">The plenteous board high heap'd with cates divine,</div>
    <div class="verse">And o'er the foaming bowl the laughing wine.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 822]</span></p>

<p>And again, he calls the gods "living at ease." And "at ease"
certainly means "without labour;" as if he meant to show by this
expression, that the greatest of all evils is labour and trouble in
life.</p>

<p>6. On which account Megaclides finds fault with those poets who
came after Homer and Hesiod, and have written about Hercules, relating
how he led armies and took cities,&mdash;who passed the greater part
of his life among men in the most excessive pleasure, and married a
greater number of women than any other man; and who had unacknowledged
children, by a greater number of virgins, than any other man. For any
one might say to those who do not admit all this&mdash;"Whence, my
good friends, is it that you attribute to him all this excessive love
of eating; or whence is it that the custom has originated among men of
leaving nothing in the cup when we pour a libation to Hercules, if he
had no regard for pleasure? or why are the hot springs which rise out
of the ground universally said to be sacred to Hercules; or why are
people in the habit of calling soft couches the beds of Hercules, if
he despised all those who live luxuriously?" Accordingly, says he, the
later poets represent him as going about in the guise of a robber by
himself, having a club, and a lion's hide, and his bow. And they say
that Stesichorus of Himera was the original inventor of this fable.
But Xanthus the lyric poet, who was more ancient than Stesichorus, as
Stesichorus himself tells us, does not, according to the statement of
Megaclides, clothe him in this dress, but in that which Homer gives
him. But Stesichorus perverted a great many of the accounts given by
Xanthus, as he does also in the case of what is called the Orestea. But
Antisthenes, when he said that pleasure was a good, added&mdash;"such
as brought no repentance in its train."</p>

<p>7. But Ulysses, in Homer, appears to have been the original guide to
Epicurus, in the matter of that pleasure which he has always in his
mouth; for Ulysses says to Alcinous&mdash;</p>

<p>And in the same spirit Ulysses, at the court of Alcinous, represents
luxury and wantonness as the main end of life.</p>

<p>8. But of all nations the Persians were the first to become notorious
for their luxury; and the Persian kings even spent their winters at
Susa and their summers at Ecbatana. And Aristocles and Chares say

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 824]</span>

that Susa derives its name from the seasonable and beautiful character
of the place: for that what the Greeks call the lily, is called in
the Persian language σοῦσον. But they pass their autumns in
Persepolis; and the rest of the year they spend in Babylon. And in like
manner the kings of the Parthians spend their spring in Rhagæ, and
their winter in Babylon, and the rest of the year at Hecatompylus. And
even the very thing which the Persian monarchs used to wear on their
heads, showed plainly enough their extreme devotion to luxury. For it
was made, according to the account of Dinon, of myrrh and of something
called labyzus. And the labyzus is a sweet-smelling plant, and more
valuable than myrrh. And whenever, says Dinon, the king dismounts from
his chariot, he does not jump down, however small the height from the
chariot to the ground may be, nor is he helped down, leaning on any
one's hand, but a golden chair is always put by him, and he gets on
that to descend; on which account the king's chairbearer always follows
him. And three hundred women are his guard, as Heraclides of Cumæ
relates, in the first book of his history of Persia. And they sleep
all day, that they may watch all night; and they pass the whole night
in singing and playing, with lights burning. And very often the king
takes pleasure with them in the hall of the Melophori. The Melophori
are one of his troops of guards, all Persians by birth, having golden
apples (μῆλα) on the points of their spears, a thousand in
number, all picked men out of the main body of ten thousand Persians
who are called the Immortals. And the king used to go on foot through
this hall, very fine Sardian carpets being spread in his road, on which
no one but the king ever trod. And when he came to the last hall, then
he mounted a chariot, but sometimes he mounted a horse; but on foot
he was never seen outside of his palace. And if he went out to hunt,
his concubines also went with him. And the throne on which he used to
sit, when he was transacting business, was made of gold; and it was
surrounded by four small pillars made of gold, inlaid with precious
stones, and on them there was spread a purple cloth richly embroidered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 825]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">LUXURY OF THE PERSIANS.</div>

<p>9. But Clearchus the Solensian, in the fourth book of his Lives, having
previously spoken about the luxury of the Medes, and having said that
on this account they made eunuchs of many citizens of the neighbouring
tribes, adds, "that the institution of the Melophori was adopted by
the Persians from the Medes, being not only a revenge for what they
had suffered themselves, but also a memorial of the luxury of the
body-guards, to indicate to what a pitch of effeminacy they had come.
For, as it seems, the unseasonable and superfluous luxury of their
daily life could make even the men who are armed with spears, mere
mountebanks." And a little further on he says&mdash;"And accordingly, while
he gave to all those who could invent him any new kind of food, a prize
for their invention, he did not, while loading them with honours, allow
the food which they had invented to be set before them, but enjoyed it
all by himself, and thought this was the greatest wisdom. For this, I
imagine, is what is called the brains of Jupiter and of a king at the
same time."</p>

<p>But Chares of Mitylene, in the fifth book of his History of Alexander,
says&mdash;"The Persian kings had come to such a pitch of luxury, that
at the head of the royal couch there was a supper-room laid with
five couches, in which there were always kept five thousand talents
of gold; and this was called the king's pillow. And at his feet was
another supper-room, prepared with three couches, in which there were
constantly kept three thousand talents of silver; and this was called
the king's footstool. And in his bed-chamber there was also a golden
vine, inlaid with precious stones, above the king's bed." And this
vine, Amyntas says in his Posts, had bunches of grapes, composed of
most valuable precious stones; and not far from it there was placed a
golden bowl, the work of Theodorus of Samos. And Agathocles, in the
third book of his History of Cyzicus, says, that there is also among
the Persians a water called the golden water, and that it rises in
seventy springs; and that no one ever drinks of it but the king alone,
and the eldest of his sons. And if any one else drinks of it, the
punishment is death.</p>

<p>10. But Xenophon, in the eighth book of his Cyropædia, says&mdash;"They
still used at that time to practise the discipline of the Persians,
but the dress and effeminacy of the Medes. But now they disregard the
sight of the ancient Persian bravery becoming extinct, and they are
solicitous only to preserve the effeminacy of the Medes. And I think it

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 826]</span>

a good opportunity to give an account of their luxurious habits. For,
in the first place, it is not enough for them to have their beds softly
spread, but they put even the feet of their couches upon carpets in
order that the floor may not present resistance to them, but that the
carpets may yield to their pressure. And as for the things which are
dressed for their table, nothing is omitted which has been discovered
before, and they are also continually inventing something new; and the
same is the way with all other delicacies. For they retain men whose
sole business it is to invent things of this kind. And in winter it is
not enough for them to have their head, and their body, and their feet
covered, but on even the tips of their fingers they wear shaggy gloves
and finger-stalls; and in summer they are not satisfied with the shade
of the trees and of the rocks, but they also have men placed in them to
contrive additional means of producing shade." And in the passage which
follows this one, he proceeds to say&mdash;"But now they have more clothes
laid upon their horses than they have even on their beds. For they do
not pay so much attention to their horsemanship as to sitting softly.
Moreover, they have porters, and breadmakers, and confectioners, and
cup-bearers, and men to serve up their meals and to take them away, and
men to lull them to sleep and men to wake them, and dressers to anoint
them and to rub them, and to get them up well in every respect."</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">PROFLIGACY OF THE LYDIANS.</div>

<p>11. The Lydians, too, went to such a pitch of luxury, that they
were the first to castrate women, as Xanthus the Lydian tells us, or
whoever else it was who wrote the History which is attributed to him,
whom Artemon of Cassandra, in his treatise on the Collection of Books,
states to have been Dionysius who was surnamed Leather-armed; but
Artemon was not aware that Ephorus the historian mentions him as being
an older man than the other, and as having been the man who supplied
Herodotus with some of his materials. Xanthus, then, in the second
book of his Affairs of Lydia, says that Adramyttes, the king of the
Lydians, was the first man who ever castrated women, and used female
eunuchs instead of male eunuchs. But Clearchus, in the fourth book of
his Lives, says&mdash;"The Lydians, out of luxury, made parks; and
having planted them like gardens, made them very shady, thinking it
a refinement in luxury if the sun never touched them with its rays at
all; and at last they carried their insolence to such a height, that
they used to collect other men's wives and maidens into a place that,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 827]</span>

from this conduct, got the name of Hagneon, and there ravished them.
And at last, having become utterly effeminate, they lived wholly like
women instead of like men; on which account their age produced even
a female tyrant, in the person of one of those who had been ravished
in this way, by name Omphale. And she was the first to inflict on the
Lydians the punishment that they deserved. For to be governed and
insulted by a woman is a sufficient proof of the severity with which
they were treated. Accordingly she, being a very intemperate woman
herself, and meaning to revenge the insults to which she herself had
been subjected, gave the maiden daughters of the masters to their
slaves, in the very same place in which she herself had been ravished.
And then having forcibly collected them all in this place, she shut up
the mistresses with their slaves.</p>

<p>On which account the Lydians, wishing to soften the bitterness of the
transaction, call the place the Woman's Contest&mdash;the Sweet Embrace. And
not only were the wives of the Lydians exposed to all comers, but those
also of the Epizephyrian Locrians, and also those of the Cyprians&mdash;and,
in fact, those of all the nations who devote their daughters to the
lives of prostitutes; and it appears to be, in truth, a sort of
reminding of, and revenge for, some ancient insult. So against her a
Lydian man of noble birth rose up, one who had been previously offended
at the government of Midas; while Midas lay in effeminacy, and luxury,
and a purple robe, working in the company of the women at the loom. But
as Omphale slew all the strangers whom she admitted to her embraces, he
chastised both&mdash;the one, being a stupid and illiterate man, he dragged
out by his ears; a man who, for want of sense, had the surname of the
most stupid of all animals: but the woman....</p>

<p>12. And the Lydians were also the first people to introduce the use of
the sauce called caruca; concerning the preparation of which all those
who have written cookery books have spoken a good deal&mdash;namely, Glaucus
the Locrian, and Mithæcus, and Dionysius, and the two Heraclidæ (who
were by birth Syracusans), and Agis, and Epænetus, and Dionysius, and
also Hegesippus, and Erasistratus, and Euthydemus, and Criton; and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 828] </span>

besides these, Stephanus, and Archytas, and Acestius, and Acesias, and
Diocles, and Philistion; for I know that all these men have written
cookery books. And the Lydians, too, used to speak of a dish which
they called candaulus; and there was not one kind of candaulus only,
but three, so wholly devoted were they to luxury. And Hegesippus the
Tarentine says, that the candaulus is made of boiled meat, and grated
bread, and Phrygian cheese, and aniseed, and thick broth: and it is
mentioned by Alexis, in his Woman Working all Night, or The Spinners;
and it is a cook who is represented as speaking:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">PERSIAN CUSTOMS.</div>

<p>And the Lydians, when going out to war,
array themselves to the tune of flutes and pipes, as Herodotus says;
and the Lacedæmonians also attack their enemies keeping time to their
flutes, as the Cretans keep time to the lyre.</p>

<p>13. But Heraclides of Cumæ, who wrote the History of Persia, having
said in his book entitled The Preparation, that in the country which
produces frankincense the king is independent, and responsible to no
one, proceeds as follows:&mdash;"And he exceeds every one in luxury and
indolence; for he stays for ever in his palace, passing his whole life
in luxury and extravagance; and he does no single thing, nor does he
see many people. But he appoints the judges, and if any one thinks that
they have decided unjustly, there is a window in the highest part of
the palace, and it is fastened with a chain: accordingly, he who thinks
that an unjust decision has been given against him, takes hold of the
chain, and drags the window; and when the king hears it, he summons
the man, and hears the cause himself. And if the judges appear to have
decided unjustly, they are put to death; but if they appear to have
decided justly, then the man who has moved the window is put to death."
And it is said that the sum expended every day on the king, and on his
wives and friends, amounts to fifteen Babylonian talents.</p>

<p>14. And among the Tyrrhenians, who carry their luxury to an
extraordinary pitch, Timæus, in his first book, relates that the female
servants wait on the men in a state of nudity. And Theopompus, in the
forty-third book of his History, states, "that it is a law among the
Tyrrhenians that all their women should be in common: and that the
women pay the greatest attention to their persons, and often practise
gymnastic exercises, naked, among the men, and sometimes with one
another; for that it is not accounted shameful for them to be seen
naked. And that they sup not with their own husbands, but with any one
who happens to be present; and they pledge whoever they please in their
cups: and that they are wonderful women to drink, and very handsome.
And that the Tyrrhenians bring up all the children that are born, no
one knowing to what father each child belongs: and the children, too,
live in the same manner as those who have brought them up, having
feasts very frequently, and being intimate with all the women. Nor is
it reckoned among the Tyrrhenians at all disgraceful either to do or
suffer anything in the open air, or to be seen while it is going on;

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 830]</span>

for it is quite the custom of their country: and they are so far from
thinking it disgraceful, that they even say, when the master of the
house is indulging his appetites, and any one asks for him, that he is
doing so and so, using the coarsest possible words for his occupation.
But when they are together in parties of companions or relations, they
act in the following manner. First of all, when they have stopped
drinking, and are about to go to sleep, while the lights are still
burning, the servants introduce sometimes courtesans, and sometimes
beautiful boys, and sometimes women; and when they have enjoyed them,
they proceed to acts of still grosser licentiousness: and they indulge
their appetites, and make parties on purpose, sometimes keeping one
another in sight, but more frequently making tents around the beds,
which are made of plaited laths, with cloths thrown over them. And the
objects of their love are usually women; still they are not invariably
as particular as they might be and they are very beautiful, as is
natural for people to be who live delicately, and who take great care
of their persons."</p>

<p>And all the barbarians who live towards the west, smooth their bodies
by rubbing them with pitch, and by shaving them; and among the
Tyrrhenians there are many shops in which this trade is practised,
and many artists whose sole employment it is, just as there are
barbers among us. And when the Tyrrhenians go to these men, they give
themselves wholly up to them, not being ashamed of having spectators,
or of those who may be passing by. And many of the Greeks, and of those
who inhabit Italy, adopt this practice, having learnt it from the
Samnites and Messapians. But the Tyrrhenians (as Alcimus relates) are
so far gone in luxury, that they even make bread, and box, and flog
people to the sound of the flute.</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">THE SYBARITES.</div>

<p>15. The tables of the Sicilians also are very notorious for their
luxury. "And they say that even the sea in their region is sweet,
delighting in the food which is procured from it," as Clearchus says,
in the fifth book of his Lives. And why need we mention the Sybarites,
among whom bathing men and pourers of water were first introduced in
fetters, in order to prevent their going too fast, and to prevent also
their scalding the bathers in their haste? And the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 831]</span>

Sybarites were the first people to forbid those who practise noisy
arts from dwelling in their city; such as braziers, and smiths, and
carpenters, and men of similar trades; providing that their slumbers
should always be undisturbed. And it used to be unlawful to rear a cock
in their city.</p>

<p>And Timæus relates concerning them, that a citizen of Sybaris once
going into the country, seeing the husbandmen digging, said that he
himself felt as if he had broken his bones by the sight; and some one
who heard him replied, "I, when I heard you say this, felt as if I had
a pain in my side." And once, at Crotona, some Sybarites were standing
by some one of the athletes who was digging up dust for the palæstra,
and said they marvelled that men who had such a city had no slaves to
dig the palæstra for them. But another Sybarite, coming to Lacedæmon,
and being invited to the phiditium, sitting down on a wooden seat and
eating with them, said that originally he had been surprised at hearing
of the valour of the Lacedæmonians; but that now that he had seen it,
he thought that they in no respect surpassed other men: for that the
greatest coward on earth would rather die a thousand times than live
and endure such a life as theirs.</p>

<p>16. And it is a custom among them that even their children, up to the
age when they are ranked among the ephebi, should wear purple robes,
and curls braided with gold. And it is a custom with them also to breed
up in their houses little mannikins and dwarfs (as Timon says), who
are called by some people στίλπωνες; and also little Maltese
dogs, which follow them even to the gymnasia. And it was these men,
and men like them, to whom Masinissa, king of Mauritania, made answer
(as Ptolemy rebates, in the eighth book of his Commentaries), when
they were seeking to buy some monkeys: "Why,&mdash;do not your wives, my
good friends, produce any offspring?" For Masinissa was very fond of
children, and kept about him and brought up the children of his sons,
and of his daughters equally, and he had a great many of them: and he
brought them all up till they were three years old, and after that
he sent them to their parents, having the younger ones to take their
places. And Eubulus the comic writer has said the same thing in his
Graces:&mdash;</p>

<p>And Athenodorus, in his treatise on Serious Studies and Amusements,
says that "Archytas of Tarentum, who was both a statesman and
a philosopher, having many slaves, was always delighted at his
entertainments when any of them came to his banquets. But the Sybarites
delighted only in Maltese puppy dogs, and in men which were no men."</p>

<p>17. The Sybarites used to wear also garments made of Milesian wool,
from which there arose a great friendship between the two cities, as
Timæus relates. For of the inhabitants of Italy, the Milesians gave
the preference to the Tyrrhenians, and of foreigners to the Ionians,
because they were devoted to luxury. But the cavalry of the Sybarites,
being in number more than five thousand, used to go in procession with
saffron-coloured robes over their breastplates; and in the summer their
younger men used to go away to the caves of the Lusiades Nymphs, and
live there in all kinds of luxury. And whenever the rich men of that
country left the city for the country, although they always travelled
in chariots, still they used to consume three days in a day's journey.
And some of the roads which led to their villas in the country were
covered with awnings all over; and a great many of them had cellars
near the sea, into which their wine was brought by canals from the
country, and some of it was then sold out of the district, but some was
brought into the city in boats. They also celebrate in public numbers
of feasts; and they honour those who display great magnificence on
such occasions with golden crowns, and they proclaim their names at
the public sacrifices and games; announcing not only their general
goodwill towards the city, but also the great magnificence which they
had displayed in the feasts. And on these occasions they even crown
those cooks who have served up the most exquisite dishes. And among
the Sybarites there were found baths in which, while they lay down,
they were steamed with warm vapours. And they were the first people who
introduced the custom of bringing chamber-pots into entertainments. But
laughing at those who left their countries to travel in foreign lands,
they themselves used to boast that they had grown old without ever
having crossed the bridges which led over their frontier rivers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 833]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">THE SYBARITES.</div>

<p>18. But it seems to me, that besides the fact of the riches of the
Sybarites, the very natural character of their country,&mdash;since there
are no harbours on their coasts, and since, in consequence, nearly all
the produce of the land is consumed by the citizens themselves,&mdash;and
to some extent also an oracle of the God, has excited them all to
luxury, and has caused them to live in practices of most immoderate
dissoluteness. But their city lies in a hollow, and in summer is
liable to excess of cold both morning and evening, but in the middle
of the day the heat is intolerable, so that the greater part of them
believe that the rivers contribute a great deal to the health of the
inhabitants; on which account it has been said, that "a man who, living
at Sybaris, wishes not to die before his time, ought never to see the
sun either rise or set." And once they sent to the oracle to consult
the God (and one of the ambassadors was named Amyris), and to ask how
long their prosperity should last; and the priestess of Delphi answered
them&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">You shall be happy, Sybarite,&mdash;very happy,</div>
    <div class="verse">And all your time in entertainments pass,</div>
    <div class="verse">While you continue to th' immortal gods</div>
    <div class="verse">The worship due: but when you come, at length,</div>
    <div class="verse">To honour mortal man beyond the gods,</div>
    <div class="verse">Then foreign war and intestine sedition</div>
    <div class="verse">Shall come upon you, and shall crush your city.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>


<p>When they had heard this they thought the God had said to them that
they should never have their luxury terminated; for that there was no
chance of their ever honouring a man more than God. But in agreement
with the oracle they experienced a change of fortune, when one of them
flogging one of his slaves, continued to beat him after he had sought
an asylum in a temple; but when at last he fled to the tomb of his
father, he let him go, out of shame. But their whole revenues were
dissipated by the way in which they rivalled one another in luxury. And
the city also rivalled all other cities in luxury. And not long after
this circumstance, when many omens of impending destruction, which
it is not necessary to allude to further at present, had given them
notice, they were destroyed.</p>

<p>19. But they had carried their luxury to such a pitch that they had
taught even their horses to dance at their feasts to the music of the
flute. Accordingly the people of Crotona, knowing this, and being at

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 834]</span>

war with them, as Aristotle relates in his History of the Constitution
of Sybaris, played before their horses the air to which they were
accustomed to dance; for the people of Crotona also had flute-players
in military uniform. And as soon as the horses heard them playing on
the flute, they not only began to dance, but ran over to the army of
the Crotonians, carrying their riders with them.</p>

<p>And Charon of Lampsacus tells a similar story about the Cardians,
in the second book of his Annals, writing as follows:&mdash;"The Bisaltæ
invaded the territory of the Cardians, and conquered them. But the
general of the Bisaltæ was Onaris; and he, while he was a boy, had been
sold as a slave in Cardia; and having lived as a slave to one of the
Cardians, he had been taught the trade of a barber. And the Cardians
had an oracle warning them that the Bisaltæ would some day invade
them; and they very often used to talk over this oracle while sitting
in this barber's shop. And Onaris, escaping from Cardia to his own
country, prompted the Bisaltæ to invade the Cardians, and was himself
elected general of the Bisaltæ. But all the Cardians had been in the
habit of teaching their horses to dance at their feasts to the music of
the flute; and they, standing on their hind feet, used to dance with
their fore feet in time to the airs which they had been taught. Onaris
then, knowing these things, got a female flute-player from among the
Cardians. And this female flute-player coming to the Bisaltæ, taught
many of their flute-players; and when they had learnt sufficiently, he
took them in his army against the Cardians. And when the battle took
place, he ordered the flute-players to play the airs which they had
learnt, and which the horses of the Cardians knew. And when the horses
heard the flute, they stood up on their hind feet, and took to dancing.
But the main strength of the Cardians was in their cavalry, and so they
were conquered."</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">THE SYBARITES.</div>

<p>And one of the Sybarites, once wishing to sail over to Crotona,
hired a vessel to carry him by himself, on condition that no one was
to splash him, and that no one else was to be taken on board, and that
he might take his horse with him. And when the captain of the ship had
agreed to these terms, he put his horse on board, and ordered some
straw to be

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 835]</span>

spread under the horse. And afterwards he begged one of those who
had accompanied him down to the vessel to go with him, saying, "I
have already stipulated with the captain of the ship to keep along
the shore." But he replied, "I should have had great difficulty in
complying with your wishes if you had been going to walk along the
sea-shore, much less can I do so when you are going to sail along the
land."</p>

<p>20. But Phylarchus, in the twenty-fifth book of his History, (having
said that there was a law at Syracuse, that the women should not
wear golden ornaments, nor garments embroidered with flowers, nor
robes with purple borders, unless they professed that they were
public prostitutes; and that there was another law, that a man should
not adorn his person, nor wear any extraordinarily handsome robes,
different from the rest of the citizens, unless he meant to confess
that he was an adulterer and a profligate: and also, that a freewoman
was not to walk abroad when the sun had set, unless she was going
to commit adultery; and even by day they were not allowed to go out
without the leave of the regulators of the women, and without one
female servant following them,)&mdash;Phylarchus, I say, states, that "the
Sybarites, having given loose to their luxury, made a law that women
might be invited to banquets, and that those who intended to invite
them to sacred festivities must make preparation a year before, in
order that they might have all that time to provide themselves with
garments and other ornaments in a suitable manner worthy of the
occasion, and so might come to the banquet to which they were invited.
And if any confectioner or cook invented any peculiar and excellent
dish, no other artist was allowed to make this for a year; but he alone
who invented it was entitled to all the profit to be derived from
the manufacture of it for that time; in order that others might be
induced to labour at excelling in such pursuits. And in the same way,
it was provided that those who sold eels were not to be liable to pay
tribute, nor those who caught them either. And in the same way the laws
exempted from all burdens those who dyed the marine purple and those
who imported it."</p>

<p>21. They, then, having carried their luxury and insolence to a great
height, at last, when thirty ambassadors came to them from the people
of Crotona, slew them all, and threw their bodies down over the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 836]</span>

wall, and left them there to be eaten by beasts. And this was the
beginning of great evils to them, as the Deity was much offended at
it. Accordingly, a few days afterwards all their chief magistrates
appeared to see the same vision on one night; for they thought that
they saw Juno coming into the midst of the market-place, and vomiting
gall; and a spring of blood arose in her temple. But even then they
did not desist from their arrogance, until they were all destroyed by
the Crotonians. But Heraclides of Pontus, in his treatise on Justice,
says,&mdash;"The Sybarites having put down the tyranny of Telys, and having
destroyed all those who had exercised authority, met them and slew
them at the altars of the gods. And at the sight of this slaughter the
statue of Juno turned itself away, and the floor sent up a fountain
of blood, so that they were forced to cover all the place around with
brazen tablets, wishing to stop the rising of the blood: on which
account they were all driven from their city and destroyed. And they
had also been desirous to obscure the glory of the famous games at
Olympia; for watching the time when they are celebrated, they attempted
to draw over the athletes to their side by the extravagance of the
prizes which they offered."</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">THE TARENTINES.</div>

<p>22. And the men of Crotona, as Timæus says, after they had destroyed
the people of Sybaris, began to indulge in luxury; so that their chief
magistrate went about the city clad in a purple robe, and wearing a
golden crown on his head, and wearing also white sandals. But some
say that this was not done out of luxury, but owing to Democedes the
physician, who was by birth a native of Crotona; and who having lived
with Polycrates the tyrant of Samos, and having been taken prisoner
by the Persians after his death, was taken to the king of Persia,
after Orœtes had put Polycrates to death. And Democedes, having cured
Atossa, the wife of Darius, and daughter of Cyrus, who had a complaint
in her breast, asked of her this reward, to be sent back to Greece,
on condition of returning again to Persia; and having obtained his
request he came to Crotona. And as he wished to remain there, when some
Persian laid hold of him and said that he was a slave of the king of
Persia, the Crotonians took him away, and having stripped the Persian
of his robe, dressed the lictor of their chief magistrate in it. And

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 837]</span>

from that time forward, the lictor, having on the Persian robe, went
round with the chief magistrate to all the altars every seventh day;
not for the sake of luxury or insolence, but doing it for the purpose
of insulting the Persians. But after this the men of Crotona, as Timæus
says, attempted to put an end to the Assembly at Olympia, by appointing
a meeting for games, with enormously rich prizes, to be held at exactly
the same time as the Olympian games; but some say that the Sybarites
did this.</p>

<p>23. But Clearchus, in the fourth book of his Lives, says that the
people of Tarentum, being a very valiant and powerful people, carried
their luxury to such a height, that they used to make their whole body
smooth, and that they were the first people who set other nations an
example of this smoothness. They also, says he, all wore very beautiful
fringes on their garments; such as those with which now the life of
woman is refined. And afterwards, being led on by their luxury to
insolence, they overthrew a city of the Iapyges, called Carbina, and
collected all the boys and maidens, and women in the flower of their
age, out of it into the temples of the Carbinians; and building tents
there, they exposed them naked by day for all who chose to come and
look at them, so that whoever pleased, leaping, as it were, on this
unfortunate band, might satiate his appetites with the beauty of those
who were there assembled, in the sight of every one, and above all of
the Gods, whom they were thinking of but little. And this aroused the
indignation of the Deity, so that he struck all the Tarentines who
behaved so impiously in Carbina with his thunderbolts. And even to
this day at Tarentum every one of the houses has the same number of
pillars before its doors as that of the people whom it received back of
those who were sent to Iapygia. And, when the day comes which is the
anniversary of their death, they do not bewail those who perished at
those pillars, nor do they offer the libations which are customary in
other cases, but they offer sacrifices to Jupiter the Thunderer.</p>

<p>24. Now the race of the Iapygians came originally from Crete, being
descended from those Cretans who came to seek for Glaucus, and settled
in that part of Italy; but afterwards, they, forgetting the orderly
life of the Cretans, came to such a pitch of luxury, and from thence
to such a degree of insolence, that they were the first people who

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 838]</span>

painted their faces, and who wore headbands and false hair, and
who clothed themselves in robes embroidered with flowers, and who
considered it disgraceful to cultivate the land, or to do any kind
of labour. And most of them made their houses more beautiful than
the temples of the gods; and so they say, that the leaders of the
Iapygians, treating the Deity with insult, destroyed the images of
the gods out of the temples, ordering them to give place to their
superiors. On which account, being struck with fire and thunderbolts,
they gave rise to this report; for indeed the thunderbolts with which
they were stricken down were visible a long time afterwards. And to
this very day all their descendants live with shaven heads and in
mourning apparel, in want of all the luxuries which previously belonged
to them.</p>

<p>25. But the Spaniards, although they go about in robes like those of
the tragedians, and richly embroidered, and in tunics which reach down
to the feet, are not at all hindered by their dress from displaying
their vigour in war; but the people of Massilia became very effeminate,
wearing the same highly ornamented kind of dress which the Spaniards
used to wear; but they behave in a shameless manner, on account of
the effeminacy of their souls, behaving like women, out of luxury:
from which the proverb has gone about,&mdash;May you sail to Massilia. And
the inhabitants of Siris, which place was first inhabited by people
who touched there on their return from Troy, and after them by the
Colophonians, as Timæus and Aristotle tell us, indulged in luxury no
less than the Sybarites; for it was a peculiar national custom of
theirs to wear embroidered tunics, which they girded up with expensive
girdles (μίτραι); and on this account they were called by the
inhabitants of the adjacent countries ηιτροχίτωνες, since
Homer calls those who have no girdles ἀμιτροχίτωνες. And
Archilochus the poet marvelled beyond anything at the country of the
Siritans, and at their prosperity. Accordingly, speaking of Thasos as
inferior to Siris, he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">For there is not on earth a place so sweet,</div>
    <div class="verse">Or lovely, or desirable as that</div>
    <div class="verse">Which stands upon the stream of gentle Siris.</div>

  </div>
 </div>
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 839]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">THE MILESIANS.</div>

<p>But the place was called Siris, as Timæus asserts, and as Euripides
says too in his play called The Female Prisoner, or Melanippe, from
a woman named Siris, but according to Archilochus, from a river of
the same name. And the number of the population was very great in
proportion to the size of the place and extent of the country, owing
to the luxurious and delicious character of the climate all around. On
which account nearly all that part of Italy which was colonised by the
Greeks was called Magna Græcia.</p>

<p>26. "But the Milesians, as long as they abstained from luxury,
conquered the Scythians," as Ephorus says, "and founded all the cities
on the Hellespont, and settled all the country about the Euxine Sea
with beautiful cities. And they all betook themselves to Miletus.
But when they were enervated by pleasure and luxury, all the valiant
character of the city disappeared, as Aristotle tells us; and indeed a
proverb arose from them,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>


<p>Heraclides of Pontus, in the second book of his treatise on Justice,
says,&mdash;"The city of the Milesians fell into misfortunes, on account of
the luxurious lives of the citizens, and on account of the political
factions; for the citizens, not loving equity, destroyed their enemies
root and branch. For all the rich men and the populace formed opposite
factions (and they call the populace Gergithæ). At first the people got
the better, and drove out the rich men, and, collecting the children of
those who fled into some threshing-floors, collected a lot of oxen, and
so trampled them to death, destroying them in a most impious manner.
Therefore, when in their turn the rich men got the upper hand, they
smeared over all those whom they got into their power with pitch, and
so burnt them alive. And when they were being burnt, they say that many
other prodigies were seen, and also that a sacred olive took fire of
its own accord; on which account the God drove them for a long time
from his oracle; and when they asked the oracle on what account they
were driven away, he said&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">My heart is grieved for the defenceless Gergithæ,</div>

    <div class="verse">Which never more shall flourish or bear fruit.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>


<p>And Clearchus, in his fourth book, says that the Milesians, imitating
the luxury of the Colophonians, disseminated it among their

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 840]</span>

neighbours. And then he says that they, when reproved for it, said one
to another, "Keep at home your native Milesian wares, and publish them
not."</p>

<p>27. And concerning the Scythians, Clearchus, in what follows these last
words, proceeds to say&mdash;"The nation of the Scythians was the first to
use common laws; but after that, they became in their turn the most
miserable of all nations, on account of their insolence: for they
indulged in luxury to a degree in which no other nation did, being
prosperous in everything, and having great resources of all sorts for
such indulgences. And this is plain from the traces which exist of it
to this day in the apparel worn, and way of life practised, by their
chief men. For they, being very luxurious, and indeed being the first
men who abandoned themselves wholly to luxury, proceeded to such a
pitch of insolence that they used to cut off the noses of all the
men wherever they came; and their descendants, after they emigrated
to other countries, even now derive their name from this treatment.
But their wives used to tattoo the wives of the Thracians, (of those
Thracians, that is, who lived on the northern and western frontiers
of Scythia,) all over their bodies, drawing figures on them with the
tongues of their buckles; on which account, many years afterwards, the
wives of the Thracians who had been treated in this manner effaced
this disgrace in a peculiar manner of their own, tattooing also all
the rest of their skin all over, in order that by this means the brand
of disgrace and insult which was imprinted on their bodies, being
multiplied in so various a manner, might efface the reproach by being
called an ornament. And they lorded it over all other nations in so
tyrannical a manner, that the offices of slavery, which are painful
enough to all men, made it plain to all succeeding ages what was the
real character of "a Scythian command."</p>

<p>Therefore, on account of the number of disasters which oppressed them,
since every people had lost, through grief, all the comforts of life,
and all their hair at the same time, foreign nations called all cutting
of the hair which is done by way of insult, aposkythizomai.</p>

your property from their hands, went away by sea to Abydus,&mdash;not for
the purpose of transacting any private business of your own, nor on
account of any commission of the state respecting any public rights
of hospitality; but, led only by your own lawless and intemperate
disposition, to learn lascivious habits and actions from the women at
Abydus, in order that you might be able to put them in practice during
the remainder of your life."</p>

<p>29. The Magnesians also, who lived on the banks of the Mæander, were
undone because they indulged in too much luxury, as Callinus relates in
his Elegies; and Archilochus confirms this: for the city of Magnesia
was taken by the Ephesians. And concerning these same Ephesians,
Democritus, who was himself an Ephesian, speaks in the first book of
his treatise on the Temple of Diana at Ephesus; where, relating their
excessive effeminacy, and the dyed garments which they used to wear, he
uses these expressions:&mdash;"And as for the violet and purple robes of the
Ionians, and their saffron garments, embroidered with round figures,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 842]</span>

those are known to every one; and the caps which they wear on their
heads are in like manner embroidered with figures of animals. They wear
also garments called sarapes, of yellow, or scarlet, or white, and
some even of purple: and they wear also long robes called calasires,
of Corinthian workmanship; and some of these are purple, and some
violet-coloured, and some hyacinth-coloured; and one may also see some
which are of a fiery red, and others which are of a sea-green colour.
There are also Persian calasires, which are the most beautiful of
all. And one may see also," continues Democritus, "the garments which
they call actææ; and the actæa is the most costly of all the Persian
articles of dress: and this actæa is woven for the sake of fineness and
of strength, and it is ornamented all over with golden millet-grains;
and all the millet-grains have knots of purple thread passing through
the middle, to fasten them inside the garment." And he says that the
Ephesians use all these things, being wholly devoted to luxury.</p>

<p>30. But Duris, speaking concerning the luxury of the Samians, quotes
the poems of Asius, to prove that they used to wear armlets on their
arms; and that, when celebrating the festival of the Heræa, they used
to go about with their hair carefully combed down over the back of
their head and over their shoulders; and he says that this is proved
to have been their regular practice by this proverb&mdash;"To go, like a
worshipper of Juno, with his hair braided."</p>

<p>Now the verses of Asius run as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

a very rigid course of life, when, in consequence of the alliance and
friendship which they formed with the Lydians, they began to give way
to luxury, used to go into public with their hair adorned with golden
ornaments, as Xenophanes tells us&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse">They learnt all sorts of useless foolishness</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">From the effeminate Lydians, while they</div>
    <div class="verse">Were held in bondage to sharp tyranny.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">They went into the forum richly clad</div>
    <div class="verse">In purple garments, in numerous companies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Whose strength was not less than a thousand men,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Dripping with costly and sweet-smelling oils.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>


<p>And to such a degree did they carry their dissoluteness and their
unseemly drunkenness, that some of them never once saw the sun either
rise or set: and they passed a law, which continued even to our
time, that the female flute-players and female harpers, and all such
musicians and singers, should receive pay from daybreak to midday, and
until the lamps were lighted; but after that they set aside the rest
of the night to get drunk in. And Theopompus, in the fifteenth book of
his History, says, "that a thousand men of that city used to walk about
the city, wearing purple garments, which was at that time a colour rare
even among kings, and greatly sought after; for purple was constantly
sold for its weight in silver. And so, owing to these practices, they
fell under the power of tyrants, and became torn by factions, and so
were undone with their country." And Diogenes the Babylonian gave the
same account of them, in the first book of his Laws. And Antiphanes,
speaking generally of the luxury of all the Ionians, has the following
lines in his Dodona:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse">Say, from what country do you come, what land</div>

    <div class="verse">From cities of Ionia that here approaches?</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>


<p>And Theophrastus, in his essay on Pleasure, says that the Ionians, on
account of the extraordinary height to which they carried their luxury,
gave rise to what is now known as the golden proverb.</p>

<p>32. And Theopompus, in the eighth book of his History of the Affairs
of Philip, says that some of those tribes which live on the sea-coast
are exceedingly luxurious in their manner of living. But about the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 844]</span>

Byzantians and Chalcedonians, the same Theopompus makes the following
statement:&mdash;"But the Byzantians, because they had been governed a
long time by a democracy, and because their city was so situated as
to be a kind of mart, and because the whole people spent the whole
of their time in the market-place and about the harbour, were very
intemperate, and in the constant habit of feasting and drinking at the
wine-sellers'. But the Chalcedonians, before they became members of the
same city with them, were men who at all times cultivated better habits
and principles of life; but after they had tasted of the democracy of
the Byzantians, they fell into ruinous luxury, and, from having been
most temperate and moderate in their daily life, they became a nation
of hard drinkers, and very extravagant." And, in the twenty-first book
of the History of the Affairs of Philip, he says that the nation of
the Umbrians (and that is a tribe which lives on the shores of the
Hadriatic) was exceedingly devoted to luxury, and lived in a manner
very like the Lydians, and had a fertile country, owing to which they
advanced in prosperity.</p>

<p>33. But speaking about the Thessalians, in his fourth book, he says
that "they spend all their time among dancing women and flute-playing
women, and some spend all the day in dice and drinking, and similar
pastimes; and they are more anxious how they may display their tables
loaded with all kinds of food, than how they may exhibit a regular and
orderly life. But the Pharsalians," says he, "are of all men the most
indolent and the most extravagant." And the Thessalians are confessed
(as Critias says) to be the most extravagant of all the Greeks, both in
their way of living and in their apparel; which was a reason why they
conducted the Persians into Greece, desiring to copy their luxury and
expense.</p>

<p>But concerning the Ætolians, Polybius tells us, in the thirteenth
book of his History, that on account of their continual wars, and
the extravagance of their lives, they became involved in debt. And
Agatharchides, in the twelfth book of his Histories, says&mdash;"The
Ætolians are so much the more ready to encounter death, in proportion
as they seek to live extravagantly and with greater prodigality than
any other nation."</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">LUXURY OF THE SYRIANS.</div>

<p>34. But the Sicilians, and especially the Syracusans, are very
notorious for their luxury; as Aristophanes also tells us, in his
Daitaleis, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">But after that I sent you, you did not</div>

    <div class="verse">And to drink Chian wine in Spartan cups.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>


<p>But Plato, in his Epistles, says&mdash;"It was with this intention that I
went to Italy and Sicily, when I paid my first visit there. But when I
got there, the way of life that I found there was not at all pleasing
to me; for twice in the day they eat to satiety, and they never sleep
alone at night; and they indulge also in all other such practices as
naturally follow on such habits: for, after such habits as these, no
man in all the world, who has been bred up in them from his youth, can
possibly turn out sensible; and as for being temperate and virtuous,
that none of them ever think of." And in the third book of his Polity
he writes as follows:&mdash;"It seems to me, my friend, that you do not
approve of the Syracusan tables, and the Sicilian variety of dishes;
and you do not approve either of men, who wish to preserve a vigorous
constitution, devoting themselves to Corinthian mistresses; nor do
you much admire the delicacy which is usually attributed to Athenian
sweetmeats."</p>

<p>35. But Posidonius, in the sixteenth book of his Histories, speaking
of the cities in Syria, and saying how luxurious they were, writes
as follows:&mdash;"The inhabitants of the towns, on account of the great
fertility of the land, used to derive great revenues from their
estates, and after their labours for necessary things used to celebrate
frequent entertainments, at which they feasted incessantly, using their
gymnasia for baths, and anointing themselves with very costly oils and
perfumes; and they passed all their time in their γραμματεῖα,
for that was the name which they gave to their public banqueting-rooms,
as if they had been their own private houses; and the greater part
of the day they remained in them, filling their bellies with meat
and drink, so as even to carry away a good deal to eat at home; and
they delighted their ears with the music of a noisy lyre, so that
whole cities resounded with such noises." But Agatharchides, in the
thirty-fifth book of his Affairs of Europe, says&mdash;"The Arycandians of
Lycia, being neighbours of the Limyres, having got involved in debt,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 846]</span>

on account of the intemperance and extravagance of their way of living,
and, by reason of their indolence and devotion to pleasure, being
unable to discharge their debts, placed all their hopes on Mithridates,
thinking that he would reward them with a general abolition of debts."
And, in his thirty-first book, he says that the Zacynthians were
inexperienced in war, because they were accustomed to live in ease and
opulence.</p>

<p>36. And Polybius, in his seventh book, says, that the inhabitants
of Capua in Campania, having become exceedingly rich through the
excellence of their soil, fell into habits of luxury and extravagance,
exceeding all that is reported of the inhabitants of Crotona or
Sybaris. "Accordingly," says he, "they, not being able to bear their
present prosperity, called in Hannibal, owing to which act they
afterwards suffered intolerable calamities at the hands of the Romans.
But the people of Petelia, who kept the promises which they had made to
the Romans, behaved with such resolution and fortitude when besieged by
Hannibal, that they did not surrender till they had eaten all the hides
which there were in the city, and the bark and young branches of all
the trees which grew in the city, and till they had endured a siege for
eleven months, without any one coming to their assistance; and they did
not even then surrender without the permission of the Romans."</p>

<p>37. And Phylarchus, in the eleventh book of his History, says that
Æschylus says that the Curetes derived their name from their luxurious
habits&mdash;</p>

<p>And Agathon in his Thyestes says, that "the suitors who courted the

<div class="sidenote-left">LUXURY OF THE ASIATIC KINGS.</div>

<p>And the people of Cumæ in Italy, as Hyperochus tells us, or whoever
else it was who wrote the History of Cumæ which is attributed to him, wore golden brocaded garments all day, and robes
embroidered with flowers; and used to go to the fields with their
wives, riding in chariots.&mdash;And this is what I have to say about the
luxury of nations and cities.</p>

<p>38. But of individual instances I have heard the following
stories:&mdash;Ctesias, in the third book of his History of Persia, says,
that all those who were ever kings in Asia devoted themselves mainly
to luxury; and above all of them, Ninyas did so, the son of Ninus and
Semiramis. He, therefore, remaining in-doors and living luxuriously,
was never seen by any one, except by his eunuchs and by his own women.</p>

<p>And another king of this sort was Sardanapalus, whom some call the
son of Anacyndaraxes, and others the son of Anabaxarus. And so, when
Arbaces, who was one of the generals under him, a Mede by birth,
endeavoured to manage, by the assistance of one of the eunuchs, whose
name was Sparamizus, to see Sardanapalus; and when he with difficulty
prevailed upon him, with the consent of the king himself,&mdash;when the
Mede entered and saw him, painted with vermilion and adorned like a
woman, sitting among his concubines carding purple wool, and sitting
among them with his feet up, wearing a woman's robe, and with his beard
carefully scraped, and his face smoothed with pumice-stone (for he
was whiter than milk, and pencilled under his eyes and eyebrows; and
when he saw Arbaces, he was just putting a little more white under his
eyes), most historians, among whom Duris is one, relate that Arbaces,
being indignant at his countrymen being ruled over by such a monarch
as that, stabbed him and slew him. But Ctesias says that he went to
war with him, and collected a great army, and then that Sardanapalus,
being dethroned by Arbaces, died, burning himself alive in his palace,
having heaped up a funeral pile four plethra in extent, on which he
placed a hundred and fifty golden couches, and a corresponding number
of tables, these, too, being all made of gold. And he also erected on
the funeral pile a chamber a hundred feet long, made of wood; and in
it he had couches spread, and there he himself lay down with his wife,
and his concubines lay on other couches around. For he had sent on his
three sons and his daughters, when he saw that his affairs were getting
in a dangerous state, to Nineveh, to the king of that city, giving them
three thousand talents of gold. And he made the roof of this apartment

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 848]</span>

of large stout beams, and then all the walls of it he made of numerous
thick planks, so that it was impossible to escape out of it. And in
it he placed ten millions of talents of gold, and a hundred millions
of talents of silver, and robes, and purple garments, and every kind
of apparel imaginable. And after that he bade the slaves set fire to
the pile; and it was fifteen days burning. And those who saw the smoke
wondered, and thought that he was celebrating a great sacrifice; but
the eunuchs alone knew what was really being done. And in this way
Sardanapalus, who had spent his life in extraordinary luxury, died with
as much magnanimity as possible.</p>

<p>39. But Clearchus, relating the history of the king of Persia, says
that&mdash;"in a very prudent manner he proposed prizes for any one who
could invent any delicious food. For this is what, I imagine, is meant
by the brains of Jupiter and the king. On which account," continues he,
"Sardanapalus was the most happy of all monarchs, who during his whole
life preferred enjoyment to everything else, and who, even after his
death, shows by his fingers, in the figure carved on his tomb, how much
ridicule all human affairs deserve, being not worth the snap of his
fingers which he makes . . . . . . . . anxiety about other things."</p>

<p>However, Sardanapalus does not appear to have lived all his life in
entire inaction; for the inscription on his tomb says&mdash;</p>

<p>And Amyntas, in the third book of his Account of the Posts, says
that at Nineveh there is a very high mound, which Cyrus levelled
with the ground when he besieged the city, and raised another mound
against the city; and that this mound was said to have been erected by
Sardanapalus the son of King Ninus; and that on it there was said to be
inscribed, on a marble pillar and in Chaldaic characters, the following
inscription, which Chærilus translated into Greek, and reduced to
metre. And the inscription is as follows&mdash;</p>

<p>But Clitarchus, in the fourth book of his History of Alexander, says
that Sardanapalus died of old age after he had lost the sovereignty
over the Syrians. And Aristobulus says&mdash;"In Anchiale, which was built
by Sardanapalus, did Alexander, when he was on his expedition against
the Persians, pitch his camp. And at no great distance was the monument
of Sardanapalus, on which there was a marble figure putting together
the fingers of its right hand, as if it were giving a fillip. And there
was on it the following inscription in Assyrian characters&mdash;</p>

so was also Androcotus the Phrygian. For he also used to wear a robe
embroidered with flowers; and to adorn himself more superbly than a
woman, as Mnaseas relates, in the third book of his History of Europe.
But Clearchus, in the fifth book of his Lives, says that Sagaus the
king of the Mariandyni used, out of luxury, to eat, till he arrived at
old age, out of his nurse's mouth, that he might not have the trouble
of chewing his own food; and that he never put his hand lower than
his navel; on which account Aristotle, laughing at Xenocrates the
Chalcedonian, for a similar preposterous piece of laziness, says&mdash;</p>

<p>And Ctesias relates that Annarus, a lieutenant of the king of Persia,
and governor of Babylon, wore the entire dress and ornaments of a
woman; and though he was only a slave of the king, there used to come
into the room while he was at supper a hundred and fifty women playing
the lyre and singing. And they played and sang all the time that he was

<div class="sidenote-left">PHILIP.</div>

<p>41. But Theopompus, in the fifteenth book of his History of Philip,
says that "Straton the king of Sidon surpassed all men in luxury and
devotion to pleasure. For as Homer has represented the Phæacians
as living feasting and drinking, and listening to harp-players and
rhapsodists, so also did Straton pass the whole of his life; and so
much the more devoted to pleasure was he than they, that the Phæacians,
as Homer reports, used to hold their banquets in the company of their
own wives and daughters; but Straton used to prepare his entertainments
with flute-playing and harp-playing and lyre-playing women. And he sent
for many courtesans from Peloponnesus, and for many musicians from
Ionia, and for other girls from every part of Greece; some skilful in
singing and some in dancing, for exhibitions of skill in which they had
contests before himself and his friends; and with these women he spent
a great deal of his time. He then,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 851]</span>

delighting in such a life as this, and being by nature a slave to
his passions, was also especially urged on by rivalry with Nicocles.
For he and Nicocles were always rivalling one another; each of them
devoted all his attention to living more luxuriously and pleasantly
than the other. And so they carried their emulation to such a height,
as we have heard, that when either of them heard from his visitors
what was the furniture of the other's house, and how great was the
expense gone to by the other for any sacrifice, he immediately set to
work to surpass him in such things. And they were anxious to appear to
all men prosperous and deserving of envy. Not but what neither of them
continued prosperous throughout the whole of their lives, but were both
of them destroyed by violent deaths."</p>

<p>And Anaximenes, in his book entitled the Reverses of Kings, giving
the same account of Straton, says that he was always endeavouring to
rival Nicocles, who was the king of Salamis in Cyprus, and who was
exceedingly devoted to luxury and debauchery, and that they both came
to a violent end.</p>

<p>42. And in the first book of his History of the Affairs of Philip,
Theopompus, speaking of Philip, says&mdash;"And on the third day he comes
to Onocarsis, which was a strong place in Thrace, having a large
grove kept in beautiful order, and full of every resource for living
pleasantly, especially during the summer. For it was one of the
places which had been especially selected by Cotys, who, of all the
kings that ever lived in Thrace, was the most eager in his pursuit of
pleasure and luxury. And going round all the country, wherever he saw
any place shaded with trees and well watered with springs, he made it
into a banqueting place. And going to them whenever he chose, he used
to celebrate sacrifices to the Gods, and there he would stay with his
lieutenants, being a very happy and enviable man, until he took it
into his head to blaspheme Minerva, and to treat her with contempt."
And the historian goes on to say, that Cotys once prepared a feast, as
if Minerva had married him; and prepared a bed-chamber for her, and
then, in a state of intoxication, he waited for the goddess. And being
already totally out of his mind, he sent one of his body-guards to see
whether the goddess had arrived at the bed-chamber. And when he came
there, and went back and reported that there was nobody there, he shot

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 852]</span>

him and killed him. And he treated a second in the same way, until a
third went, and on his return told him that the goddess had been a long
time waiting for him. And this king, being once jealous of his wife,
cut her up with his own hands, beginning at her legs.</p>

<p>43. But in the thirteenth book of his History of the Affairs of Philip,
speaking of Chabrias the Athenian, he says&mdash;"But he was unable to live
in the city, partly on account of his intemperance, and partly because
of the extravagant habits of his daily life, and partly because of the
Athenians. For they are always unfavourable to eminent men; on which
account their most illustrious citizens preferred to live out of the
city. For instance, Iphicrates lived in Thrace, and Conon in Cyprus,
and Timotheus in Lesbos, and Chares at Sigeum, and Chabrias himself in
Egypt." And about Chares he says, in his forty-fifth book&mdash;"But Chares
was a slow and stupid man, and one wholly devoted to pleasure. And
even when he was engaged in his military expeditions, he used to take
about with him female flute-players, and female harp-players, and a lot
of common courtesans. And of the money which was contributed for the
purposes of the war, some he expended on this sort of profligacy, and
some he left behind at Athens, to be distributed among the orators and
those who propose decrees, and on those private individuals who had
actions depending. And for all this the Athenian populace was so far
from being indignant, that for this very reason he became more popular
than any other citizen; and naturally too: for they all lived in this
manner, that their young men spent all their time among flute-players
and courtesans; and those who were a little older than they, devoted
themselves to gambling, and profligacy of that sort; and the whole
people spent more money on its public banquets and entertainments than
on the provision necessary for the well-doing of the state.</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">THE PISISTRATIDÆ.</div>

<p>But in the work of Theopompus, entitled, "Concerning the Money of which
the Temple at Delphi was pillaged," he says&mdash;"Chares the Athenian got
sixty talents by means of Lysander. And with this money he gave a
banquet to the Athenians in the market-place, celebrating a triumphal
sacrifice in honour of their victory gained in the battle which

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 853]</span>

took place against the foreign troops of Philip." And these troops were
commanded by Adæus, surnamed the Cock, concerning whom Heraclides the
comic poet speaks in the following manner&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse">So liberal and magnificent was he.</div>

  </div>
 </div>

<p>And Duris gives the same account.</p>

<p>44. But Idomeneus tells us that the Pisistratidæ also, Hippias and
Hipparchus, instituted banquets and entertainments; on which account
they had a vast quantity of horses and other articles of luxury. And
this it was that made their government so oppressive. And yet their
father, Pisistratus, had been a moderate man in his pleasures, so that
he never stationed guards in his fortified places, nor in his gardens,
as Theopompus relates in his twenty-first book, but let any one who
chose come in and enjoy them, and take whatever he pleased. And Cimon
afterwards adopted the same conduct, in imitation of Pisistratus. And
Theopompus mentions Cimon in the tenth book of his History of the
Affairs of Philip, saying&mdash;"Cimon the Athenian never placed any one in
his fields or gardens to protect the fruit, in order that any of the
citizens who chose might go in and pick the fruit, and take whatever
they wanted in those places. And besides this, he opened his house to
every one, and made a daily practice of providing a plain meal for a
great number of people; and all the poor Athenians who came that way
might enter and partake of it. He also paid great attention to all
those who from day-to-day came to ask something of him; and they say
that he used always to take about with him one or two young men bearing
bags of money. And he ordered them to give money to whoever came to him
to ask anything of him. And they say that he also often contributed
towards the expense of funerals. And this too is a thing that he often
did; whenever he met any citizen badly clad, he used to order one of
the young men who were following him to change cloaks with him. And so
by all these means he acquired a high reputation, and was the first of
all the citizens."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 854]</span></p>

<p>But Pisistratus was in many respects very oppressive; and some say
that that statue of Bacchus which there is at Athens was made in his
likeness.</p>

<p>45. And Heraclides of Pontus, in his treatise on Pleasure, says that
Pericles, nicknamed the Olympian, after he got rid of his wife out
of his house, and devoted himself to a life of pleasure, lived with
Aspasia, the courtesan from Megara, and spent the greater part of
his substance on her. And Themistocles, when the Athenians were not
yet in such a state of intoxication, and had not yet begun to use
courtesans, openly filled a chariot with prostitutes, and drove early
in the morning through the Ceramicus when it was full. But Idomeneus
has made this statement in an ambiguous manner, so as to leave it
uncertain whether he means that he harnessed the prostitutes in his
chariot like horses, or merely that he made them mount his four-horsed
chariot. And Possis, in the third book of his History of the Affairs
of Magnesia, says, that Themistocles, having been invested with a
crowned magistracy in Magnesia, sacrificed to Minerva, and called the
festival the Panathenæa. And he sacrificed also to Dionysius Choopotes,
and celebrated the festival of the Choeis there. But Clearchus, in the
first book of his treatise on Friendship, says that Themistocles had
a triclinium of great beauty made for him, and said that he should be
quite contented if he could fill that with friends.</p>

<p>46. And Chamæleon of Pontus, in his Essay on Anacreon, having quoted
these lines&mdash;</p>

<p>says that Artemo derived this nickname from living luxuriously, and
being carried about (περιφέρεσθαι) on a couch. For Anacreon

<div class="sidenote-left">ALCIBIADES.</div>

<p>47. But Satyrus, speaking of the beautiful Alcibiades, says,&mdash;"It
is said that when he was in Ionia, he was more luxurious than the
Ionians themselves. And when he was in Thebes he trained himself, and
practised gymnastic exercises, being more of a Bœotian than the Thebans
themselves. And in Thessaly he loved horses and drove chariots; being
fonder of horses than the Aleuadæ: and at Sparta he practised courage
and fortitude, and surpassed the Lacedæmonians themselves. And again,
in Thrace he out-drank even the Thracians themselves. And once wishing
to tempt his wife, he sent her a thousand Darics in another man's
name: and being exceedingly beautiful in his person, he cherished his
hair the greater part of his life, and used to wear an extraordinary
kind of shoe, which is called Alcibias from him. And whenever he was a
choregus, he made a procession clad in a purple robe; and going into
the theatre he was admired not only by the men, but also by the women:
on which account Antisthenes, the pupil of Socrates, who often had seen
Alcibiades, speaks of him as a powerful and manly man, and impatient
of restraint, and audacious, and exceedingly beautiful through all his
life.</p>

<p>"And whenever he went on a journey he used four of the
allied cities as his maid-servants. For the Ephesians used to
put up a Persian tent for him; and the Chians used to find
him food for his horses; and the people of Cyzicus supplied
him with victims for his sacrifices and banquets; and the
Lesbians gave him wine, and everything else which he wanted
for his daily food. And when he came to Athens from
Olympia, he offered up two pictures, the work of Aglaophon:
one of which represented the priestesses of Olympia and
Delphi crowning him; and in the other Nemea was sitting,
and Alcibiades on her knees, appearing more beautiful than
any of the women. And even when on military expeditions
he wished to appear beautiful; accordingly he had a shield

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 856]</span>

made of gold and ivory, on which was carved Love brandishing
a thunderbolt as the ensign. And once having gone to
supper at the house of Anytus, by whom he was greatly
beloved, and who was a rich man, when one of the company
who was supping there with him was Thrasyllus, (and he was
a poor man,) he pledged Thrasyllus in half the cups which
were set out on the side-board, and then ordered the servants
to carry them to Thrasyllus's house; and then he
very civilly wished Anytus good night, and so departed. But
Anytus, in a very affectionate and liberal spirit, when some
one said what an inconsiderate thing Alcibiades had done;
'No, by Jove,' said he, 'but what a kind and considerate
thing; for when he had the power to have taken away everything,
he has left me half.'"</p>

<p>48. And Lysias the orator, speaking of his luxury, says&mdash;"For Axiochus
and Alcibiades having sailed to the Hellespont, married at Abydus, both
of them marrying one wife, Medontias of Abydus, and both cohabited with
her. After this they had a daughter, and they said that they could
not tell whose daughter she was; and when she was old enough to be
married, they both cohabited with her too; and when Alcibiades came to
her, he said that she was the daughter of Axiochus, and Axiochus in
his turn said she was the daughter of Alcibiades." And he is ridiculed
by Eupolis, after the fashion of the comic writers, as being very
intemperate with regard to women; for Eupolis says in his Flatterers&mdash;</p>

<p>And when he was at Sparta he seduced Timæa, the wife of
Agis the king. And when some people reproached him for
so doing, he said, "that he did not intrigue with her out of
incontinence, but in order that a son of his might be king at
Sparta; and that the kings might no longer be said to be
descended from Hercules, but from Alcibiades:" and when he
was engaged in his military expeditions, he used to take about,
with him Timandra, the mother of Lais the Corinthian, and
Theodote, who was an Athenian courtesan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 857]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">PAUSANIAS.</div>

<p>49. But after his banishment, having made the Athenians masters of the
Hellespont, and having taken more than five thousand Peloponnesians
prisoners, he sent them to Athens; and after this, returning to his
country, he crowned the Attic triremes with branches, and mitres, and
fillets. And fastening to his own vessels a quantity of ships which he
had taken, with their beaks broken off, to the number of two hundred,
and conveying also transports full of Lacedæmonian and Peloponnesian
spoils and arms, he sailed into the Piræus: and the trireme in which he
himself was, ran up to the very bars of the Piræus with purple sails;
and when it got inside the harbour, and when the rowers took their
oars, Chrysogonus played on a flute the trieric air, clad in a Persian
robe, and Callippides the tragedian, clad in a theatrical dress, gave
the word to the rowers. On account of which some one said with great
wit&mdash;"Sparta could never have endured two Lysanders, nor Athens two
Alcibiadeses." But Alcibiades was imitating the Medism of Pausanias,
and when he was staying with Pharnabazus, he put on a Persian robe, and
learnt the Persian language, as Themistocles had done.</p>

<p>50. And Duris says, in the twenty-second book of his
History,&mdash;"Pausanias, the king of Lacedæmon, having laid aside the
national cloak of Lacedæmon, adopted the Persian dress. And Dionysius,
the tyrant of Sicily, adopted a theatrical robe and a golden tragic
crown with a clasp. And Alexander, when he became master of Asia, also
adopted the Persian dress. But Demetrius outdid them all; for the
very shoes which he wore he had made in a most costly manner; for in
its form it was a kind of buskin, made of most expensive purple wool;
and on this the makers wove a great deal of golden embroidery, both
before and behind; and his cloak was of a brilliant tawny colour; and,
in short, a representation of the heavens was woven into it, having
the stars and twelve signs of the Zodiac all wrought in gold; and
his head-band was spangled all over with gold, binding on a purple
broad-brimmed hat in such a manner that the outer fringes hung down
the back. And when the Demetrian festival was celebrated at Athens,
Demetrius himself was painted on the proscenium, sitting on the world."
And Nymphis of Heraclea, in the sixth book of his treatise on his
Country, says&mdash;"Pausanias, who defeated Mardonius at Platæa, having

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 858]</span>

transgressed the laws of Sparta, and given himself up to pride, when
staying near Byzantium, dared to put an inscription on the brazen
goblet which is there consecrated to the gods, whose temple is at the
entrance of the strait, (and the goblet is in existence to this day,)
as if he had dedicated it himself; putting this inscription on it,
forgetting himself through his luxury and arrogance&mdash;</p>

<p>51. "Pharax the Lacedæmonian also indulged himself in luxury," as
Theopompus tells us in the fourteenth book of his History, "and he
abandoned himself to pleasure in so dissolute and unrestrained a
manner, that by reason of his intemperance he was much oftener taken
for a Sicilian, than for a Spartan by reason of his country." And in
his fifty-second book he says that "Archidamus the Lacedæmonian, having
abandoned his national customs, adopted foreign and effeminate habits;
so that he could not endure the way of life which existed in his own
country, but was always, by reason of his intemperance, anxious to live
in foreign countries. And when the Tarentines sent an embassy about
an alliance, he was anxious to go out with them as an ally; and being
there, and having been slain in the wars, he was not thought worthy
even of a burial, although the Tarentines offered a great deal of money
to the enemy to be allowed to take up his body."</p>

<p>And Phylarchus, in the tenth book of his Histories, says that
Isanthes was the king of that tribe of Thracians called Crobyzi, and
that he surpassed all the men of his time in luxury; and he was a
rich man, and very handsome. And the same historian tells us, in his
twenty-second book, that Ptolemy the Second, king of Egypt, the most
admirable of all princes, and the most learned and accomplished of men,
was so beguiled and debased in his mind by his unseasonable luxury,
that he actually dreamed that he should live for ever, and said that
he alone had found out how to become immortal. And once, after he had
been afflicted by the gout for many days, when at last he got a little
better, and saw through his window-blinds some Egyptians dining by the
river side, and eating whatever it might be that they had, and lying at
random on the sand, "O wretched man that I am," said he, "that I am not
one of those men!"</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">DIOMNESTUS.</div>

<p>52. Now Callias and his flatterers we have already sufficiently
mentioned. But since Heraclides of Pontus, in his treatise on
Pleasures, speaks of him, we will return to the subject and quote what
he says:&mdash;"When first the Persians made an expedition against Greece,
there was, as they say, an Eretrian of the name of Diomnestus, who
became master of all the treasures of the general; for he happened to
have pitched his tent in his field, and to have put his money away in
some room of his house. But when the Persians were all destroyed, then
Diomnestus took the money without any one being aware of it; but when
the king of Persia sent an army into Eretria the second time, ordering
his generals utterly to destroy the city, then, as was natural, all
who were at all well off carried away their treasures. Accordingly
those of the family of Diomnestus who were left, secretly removed their
money to Athens, to the house of Hipponicus, the son of Callias, who
was surnamed Ammon; and when all the Eretrians had been driven out of
their city by the Persians, this family remained still in possession of
their wealth, which was great. So Hipponicus, who was the son of that
man who had originally received the deposit, begged the Athenians to
grant him a place in the Acropolis, where he might construct a room to
store up all this money in, saying that it was not safe for such vast
sums to remain in a private house. And the Athenians did grant him such
a place; but afterwards, he, being warned against such a step by his
friends, changed his mind.</p>

<p>"Callias, therefore, became the master of all this money, and lived
a life of pleasure, (for what limit was there to the flatterers who
surrounded him, or to the troops of companions who were always about
him? and what extravagance was there which he did not think nothing
of?) However, his voluptuous life afterwards reduced him so low, that
he was compelled to pass the rest of his life with one barbarian old
woman for a servant, and he was in want of actual daily necessaries,
and so he died.</p>

<p>"But who was it who got rid of the riches of Nicias of Pergasa, or of
Ischomachus? was it not Autoclees and Epiclees, who preferred living
with one another, and who considered everything second to pleasure?
and after they had squandered all this wealth, they drank hemlock

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 860]</span>

together, and so perished."</p>

<p>53. But, concerning the luxury of Alexander the Great, Ephippus the
Olynthian, in his treatise on the Deaths of Alexander and Hephæstion,
says that "he had in his park a golden throne, and couches with
silver feet, on which he used to sit and transact business with his
companions." But Nicobule says, that "while he was at supper all the
morris dancers and athletes studied to amuse the king; and at his very
last banquet, Alexander, remembering an episode in the Andromeda of
Euripides, recited it in a declamatory manner, and then drank a cup of
unmixed wine with great eagerness, and compelled all the rest to do
so too." And Ephippus tells us that "Alexander used to wear even the
sacred vestments at his entertainments; and sometimes he would wear the
purple robe, and cloven sandals, and horns of Ammon, as if he had been
the god; and sometimes he would imitate Diana, whose dress he often
wore while driving in his chariot; having on also a Persian robe, but
displaying above his shoulders the bow and javelin of the goddess.
Sometimes also he would appear in the guise of Mercury; at other times,
and indeed almost every day, he would wear a purple cloak, and a tunic
shot with white, and a cap which had a royal diadem attached to it. And
when he was in private with his friends he wore the sandals of Mercury,
and the petasus on his head, and held the caduceus in his hand. Often
also he wore a lion's skin, and carried a club, like Hercules."</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">ALEXANDER.</div>

<p>What wonder then is it, if in our time the emperor Commodus, when he
drove abroad in his chariot, had the club of Hercules lying beside
him, with a lion's skin spread at his feet, and liked to be called
Hercules, when even Alexander, the pupil of Aristotle, represented
himself as like so many gods, and even like Diana? And Alexander used
to have the floor sprinkled with exquisite perfumes and with fragrant
wine; and myrrh was burnt before him, and other kinds of incense; and
all the bystanders kept silence, or spoke only words of good omen, out
of fear. For he was a very violent man, with no regard for human life;
for he appeared to be a man of a melancholic constitution. And on one
occasion, at Ecbatana, when he was offering a sacrifice to Bacchus, and
when everything was prepared in a most lavish manner

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 861]</span>

for the banquet,&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;. and Satrabates the satrap,
feasted all the soldiers&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.
"But when a great multitude was collected to see the spectacle,"
says Ephippus, "there were on a sudden some arrogant proclamations
published, more insolent even than Persian arrogance was wont
to dictate. For, as different people were publishing different
proclamations, and proposing to make Alexander large presents, which
they called crowns; one of the keepers of his armoury, going beyond
all previous flattery, having previously arranged the matter with
Alexander, ordered the herald to proclaim that Gorgos, the keeper of
the armoury, presents Alexander, the son of Ammon, with three thousand
pieces of gold; and will also present him, when he lays siege to
Athens, with ten thousand complete suits of armour, and with an equal
number of catapults and all weapons required for the war.</p>

<p>54. And Chares, in the tenth book of his History of Alexander,
says&mdash;"When he took Darius prisoner, he celebrated a marriage-feast
for himself and his companions, having had ninety-two bedchambers
prepared in the same place. There was a house built capable of
containing a hundred couches; and in it every couch was adorned with
wedding paraphernalia to the value of twenty minæ, and was made of
silver itself; but his own bed had golden feet. And he also invited to
the banquet which he gave, all his own private friends, and those he
arranged opposite to himself and the other bridegrooms; and his forces
also belonging to the army and navy, and all the ambassadors which were
present, and all the other strangers who were staying at his court.
And the apartment was furnished in the most costly and magnificent
manner, with sumptuous garments and cloths, and beneath them were
other cloths of purple, and scarlet, and gold. And, for the sake of
solidity, pillars supported the tent, each twenty cubits long, plated
all over with gold and silver, and inlaid with precious stones; and all
around these were spread costly curtains embroidered with figures of
animals, and with gold, having gold and silver curtain-rods. And the
circumference of the court was four stadia. And the banquet took place,
beginning at the sound of a trumpet, at that marriage-feast, and on
other occasions whenever the king offered a solemn sacrifice, so that
all the army knew it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 862]</span></p>

<p>And this marriage-feast lasted five days. And a great number both
of barbarians and Greeks brought contributions to it; and also some
of the Indian tribes did so. And there were present some wonderful
conjurors&mdash;Scymnus of Tarentum, and Philistides of Syracuse, and
Heraclitus of Mitylene; after whom also Alexis of Tarentum, the
rhapsodist, exhibited his skill. There came also harp-players, who
played without singing,&mdash;Cratinus of Methymne, and Aristonymus the
Athenian, and Athenodorus the Teian. And Heraclitus the Tarentine
played on the harp, accompanying himself with his voice, and so did
Aristocrates the Theban. And of flute-players accompanied with song,
there were present Dionysius of Heraclea, and Hyperbolus of Cyzicus.
And of other flute-players there were the following, who first of all
played the air called The Pythian, and afterwards played with the
choruses,&mdash;Timotheus, Phrynichus, Caphesias, Diophantus, and also Evius
the Chalcidian. And from this time forward, those who were formerly
called Dionysio-colaces,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
were called Alexandro-colaces, on account of the extravagant liberality
of their presents, with which Alexander was pleased. And there were
also tragedians who acted,&mdash;Thessalus, and Athenodorus, and
Aristocritus; and of comic actors there were Lycon, and Phormion, and
Ariston. There was also Phasimelus the harp-player. And the crowns sent
by the ambassadors and by other people amounted in value to fifteen
thousand talents.</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">ALEXANDER.</div>

<p>55. But Polycletus of Larissa, in the eighth book of his History, says
that Alexander used to sleep on a golden, couch, and that flute-playing
men and women followed him to the camp, and that he used to drink till
daybreak. And Clearchus, in his treatise on Lives, speaking of Darius
who was dethroned by Alexander, says, "The king of the Persians offered
prizes to those who could invent pleasures for him, and by this conduct
allowed his whole empire and sovereignty to be subverted by pleasures.
Nor was he aware that he was defeating himself till others had wrested
his sceptre from him and had been proclaimed in his place." And
Phylarchus, in the twenty-third book of his History, and Agatharchides
of Cnidus, in the tenth book of his History of Asia, say that the
companions also of Alexander gave way to the most extravagant

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 863]</span>

luxury. And one of them was a man named Agnon, who used to wear golden
studs in his sandals and shoes. And Cleitus, who was surnamed The
White, whenever he was about to transact business, used to converse
with every one who came to him while walking about on a purple carpet.
And Perdiccas and Craterus, who were fond of athletic exercises, had
men follow them with hides fastened together so as to cover a place
an entire stadium in extent; and then they selected a spot within the
encampment which they had covered with these skins as an awning; and
under this they practised their gymnastics.</p>

<p>They were followed also by numerous beasts of burden, which carried
sand for the use of the palæstra. And Leonnatus and Menelaus, who
were very fond of hunting, had curtains brought after them calculated
to enclose a space a hundred stadia in circumference, with which
they fenced in a large space and then practised hunting within it.
And as for the golden plane-trees, and the golden vine&mdash;having on it
bunches of grapes made of emeralds and Indian carbuncles, and all
sorts of other stones of the most costly and magnificent description,
under which the kings of Persia used often to sit when transacting
business,&mdash;the expense of all this, says Phylarchus, was far less than
the daily sums squandered by Alexander; for he had a tent capable of
containing a hundred couches, and fifty golden pillars supported it.
And over it were spread golden canopies wrought with the most superb
and costly embroidery, to shade all the upper part of it. And first of
all, five hundred Persian Melophori stood all round the inside of it,
clad in robes of purple and apple-green; and besides them there were
bowmen to the number of a thousand, some clad in garments of a fiery
red, and others in purple; and many of them had blue cloaks. And in
front of them stood five hundred Macedonian Argyraspides; and in the
middle of the tent was placed a golden chair, on which Alexander used
to sit and transact business, his body-guards standing all around. And
on the outside, all round the tent, was a troop of elephants regularly
equipped, and a thousand Macedonians, having Macedonian dresses; and
then ten thousand Persians: and the number of those who wore purple
amounted to five hundred, to whom Alexander gave this dress for them
to wear. And though he had such a numerous retinue of friends and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 864]</span>

servants, still no one dared to approach Alexander of his own accord;
so great was his dignity and the veneration with which they regarded
him. And at that time Alexander wrote letters to the cities in Ionia,
and to the Chians first of all, to send him a quantity of purple; for
he wished all his companions to wear purple robes. And when his letter
was read among the Chians, Theocritus the philosopher being present,
said&mdash;</p>

<p>56. And Posidonius, in the twenty-eighth book of his History, says that
"Antiochus the king, who was surnamed Grypus, when he was celebrating
the games at Daphne, gave a magnificent entertainment; at which, first
of all, a distribution of entire joints took place, and after that
another distribution of geese, and hares, and antelopes all alive.
There were also," says he, "distributed golden crowns to the feasters,
and a great quantity of silver plate, and of servants, and horses, and
camels. And every one was expected to mount a camel, and drink; and
after that he was presented with the camel, and with all that was on
the camel, and the boy who stood by it." And in his fourteenth book,
speaking of his namesake Antiochus, who made war upon Arsaces, and
invaded Media, he says that "he made a feast for a great multitude
every day; at which, besides the things which were consumed, and the
heaps of fragments which were left, every one of the guests carried
away with him entire joints of beasts, and birds, and fishes which
had never been carved, all ready dressed, in sufficient quantities to
fill a waggon. And after this they were presented with a quantity of
sweetmeats, and chaplets, and crowns of myrrh and frankincense, with
turbans as long as a man, made of strips of gold brocade."</p>

<p>57. But Clytus, the pupil of Aristotle, in his History of Miletus, says
that "Polycrates, the tyrant of Samos, collected everything that was
worth speaking of everywhere to gratify his luxury, having assembled
dogs from Epirus, and goats from Scyros, and sheep from Miletus, and
swine from Sicily."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 865]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">POLYCRATES.</div>

<p>And Alexis, in the third book of his Samian Annals, says that "Samos
was adorned by Polycrates with the productions of many other cities;
as he imported Molossian and Lacedæmonian dogs, and goats from Scyros
and Naxos, and sheep from Miletus and Attica. He also," says he, "sent
for artists, promising them enormous wages. But before he became
tyrant, having prepared a number of costly couches and goblets, he
allowed any one the use of them who was preparing any marriage-feast or
extraordinary entertainment." And after hearing all these particulars
we may well admire the tyrant, because it was nowhere written that he
had sent for any women or boys from any other countries, although he
was of a very amorous constitution, and was a rival in love of Anacreon
the poet; and once, in a fit of jealousy, he cut off all the hair of
the object of his passion. And Polycrates was the first man who called
the ships which he had built Samians, in honour of his country.</p>

<p>But Clearchus says that "Polycrates, the tyrant of the effeminate
Samos, was ruined by the intemperance of his life, imitating the
effeminate practices of the Lydians; on which account, in opposition
to the place in Sardis called the beautiful Ancon, he prepared a place
in the chief city of the Samians, called Laura; he made those famous
Samian flowers in opposition to the Lydian. And the Samian Laura was a
narrow street in the city, full of common women, and of all kinds of
food calculated to gratify intemperance and to promote enjoyment, with
which he actually filled Greece. But the flowers of the Samians are the
preeminent beauty of the men and women, and indeed of the whole city,
at its festivals and banquets." And these are the words of Clearchus.
And I myself am acquainted with a narrow street in my native city of
Alexandria, which to this very day is called the Happy Street, in which
every apparatus of luxury used to be sold.</p>

<p>58. But Aristotle, in his treatise on Admirable and Wonderful Things,
says that "Alcisthenes of Sybaris, out of luxury, had a garment
prepared for him of such excessive expensiveness that he exhibited
it at Lacinium, at the festival of Juno, at which all the Italians
assemble, and that of all the things which were exhibited that was
the most admired." And he says that "Dionysius the elder afterwards
became master of it, and sold it to the Carthaginians for a hundred

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 866]</span>

and twenty talents." Polemo also speaks of it in his book entitled, A
Treatise concerning the Sacred Garments at Carthage. But concerning
Smindyrides of Sybaris, and his luxury, Herodotus has told us, in his
sixth book, saying that he sailed from Sybaris to court Agariste, the
daughter of Clisthenes the tyrant of Sicyon. "And," says he, "there
came from Italy Smindyrides, the son of Hippocrates, a citizen of
Sybaris; who carried his luxury to the greatest height that ever was
heard of among men. At all events he was attended by a thousand cooks
and bird-catchers." Timæus also mentions him in his seventh book.
But of the luxury of Dionysius the younger, who was also tyrant of
Sicily, an account is given by Satyrus the Peripatetic, in his Lives.
For he says that he used to fill rooms holding thirty couches with
feasters. And Clearchus, in the fourth book of his Lives, writes as
follows:&mdash;"But Dionysius, the son of Dionysius, the cruel oppressor of
all Sicily, when he came to the city of the Locrians, which was his
metropolis, (for Doris his mother was a Locrian woman by birth,) having
strewed the floor of the largest house in the city with wild thyme
and roses, sent for all the maidens of the Locrians in turn; and then
rolled about naked, with them naked also, on this layer of flowers,
omitting no circumstance of infamy. And so, not long afterwards, they
who had been insulted in this manner having got his wife and children
into their power, prostituted them in the public roads with great
insult, sparing them no kind of degradation. And when they had wreaked
their vengeance upon them, they thrust needles under the nails of their
fingers, and put them to death with torture. And when they were dead,
they pounded their bones in mortars, and having cut up and distributed
the rest of their flesh, they imprecated curses on all who did not
eat of it; and in accordance with this unholy imprecation, they put
their flesh into the mills with the flour, that it might be eaten by
all those who made bread. And all the other parts they sunk in the
sea. But Dionysius himself, at last going about as a begging priest
of Cybele, and beating the drum, ended his life very miserably. We,
therefore, ought to guard against what is called luxury, which is the
ruin of a man's life; and we ought to think insolence the destruction
of everything."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 867]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">AGRIGENTUM.</div>

<p>59. But Diodorus Siculus, in his books On the Library, says that "the
citizens of Agrigentum prepared for Gelon a very costly swimming-bath,
being seven stadia in circumference and twenty cubits deep; and water
was introduced into it from the rivers and fountains, and it served for
a great pond to breed fish in, and supplied great quantities of fish
for the luxury and enjoyment of Gelon. A great number of swans also,"
as he relates, "flew into it; so that it was a very beautiful sight.
But afterwards the lake was destroyed by becoming filled with mud."
And Duris, in the tenth book of his History of Agathocles, says that
near the city of Hipponium a grove is shown of extraordinary beauty,
excellently well watered; in which there is also a place called the
Horn of Amalthea; and that this grove was made by Gelon. But Silenus
of Calatia, in the third book of his History of Sicily, says that
near Syracuse there is a garden laid out in a most expensive manner,
which is called Mythus, in which Hiero the king used to transact his
business. And the whole country about Panormus,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
in Sicily, is called The Garden, because it is full of
highly-cultivated trees, as Callias tells us in the eighth book of his
History of Agathocles.</p>

<p>And Posidonius, in the eighth book of his History, speaking of
Damophilus the Sicilian, by whose means it was that the Servile war
was stirred up, and saying that he was a slave to his luxury, writes
as follows:&mdash;"He therefore was a slave to luxury and debauchery.
And he used to drive through the country on a four-wheeled chariot,
taking with him horses, and servants of great personal beauty, and
a disorderly crowd of flatterers and military boys running around
his chariot. And ultimately he, with his whole family, perished in a
disgraceful manner, being treated with the most extreme violence and
insult by his own slaves."</p>

<p>60. And Demetrius Phalereus, as Duris says in the sixteenth volume of
his Histories, being possessed of a revenue of twelve hundred talents
a-year, and spending a small portion of it on his soldiers, and on
the necessary expenses of the state, squandered all the rest of it on
gratifying his innate love of debauchery, having splendid banquets
every day, and a great number of guests to feast with him. And in the
prodigality of his expense in his entertainments, he outdid even

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 868]</span>

the Macedonians, and, at the same time, in the elegance of them, he
surpassed the Cyprians and Phœnicians. And perfumes were sprinkled
over the ground, and many of the floors in the men's apartments were
inlaid with flowers, and were exquisitely wrought in other ways by
the artists. There were also secret meetings with women, and other
scenes more shameful still. And Demetrius, who gave laws to others,
and who regulated the lives of others, exhibited in his own life an
utter contempt of all law. He also paid great attention to his personal
appearance, and dyed the hair of his head with a yellow colour, and
anointed his face with rouge, and smeared himself over with other
unguents also; for he was anxious to appear agreeable and beautiful in
the eyes of all whom he met.</p>

<p>And in the procession of the Dionysia, which he celebrated when he
was archon at Athens, a chorus sang an ode of Siromen the Solensian,
addressed to him, in which he was called, Like the Sun:&mdash;</p>

  </div>
 </div>
</div>


<p>And Carystius of Pergamus, in the third book of his Commentaries,
says&mdash;"Demetrius Phalereus, when his brother Himeræus was put to death
by Antipater, was himself staying with Nicanor; and he was accused of
having sacrificed the Epiphaneia in honour of his brother. And after
he became a friend of Cassander, he was very powerful. And at first
his dinner consisted of a kind of pickle, containing olives from all
countries, and cheese from the islands; but when he became rich, he
bought Moschion, the most skilful of all the cooks and confectioners
of that age. And he had such vast quantities of food prepared for
him every day, that, as he gave Moschion what was left each day, he
(Moschion) in two years purchased three detached houses in the city;
and insulted freeborn boys, and some of the wives of the most eminent
of the citizens: and all the boys envied Theognis, with whom he was in
love. And so important an honour was it considered to be allowed to
come near Demetrius, that, as he one day had walked about after dinner
near the Tripods, on all the following days all the most beautiful boys
came together to that place, in the hopes of being seen by him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 869]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">LUCULLUS.</div>

<p>61. And Nicolaus the Peripatetic, in the tenth book of his History,
and again in the twentieth book, says that Lucullus, when he came
to Rome and celebrated his triumph, and gave an account of the war
against Mithridates, ran into the most unbounded extravagance, after
having previously been very moderate; and was altogether the first
guide to luxury, and the first example of it, among the Romans, having
become master of the riches of two kings, Mithridates and Tigranes.
And Sittius, also, was a man very notorious among the Romans for his
luxury and effeminacy, as Rutilius tells us; for as to Apicius, we
have already spoken of him. And almost all historians relate that
Pausanias and Lysander were very notorious for their luxury; on which
account Agis said of Lysander, that Sparta had produced him as a
second Pausanias. But Theopompus, in the tenth book of his History
of the Affairs of Greece, gives exactly the contrary account of
Lysander, saying that "he was a most laborious man, able to earn the
goodwill of both private individuals and monarchs, being very moderate
and temperate, and superior to all the allurements of pleasure; and
accordingly, when he had become master of almost the whole of Greece,
it will be found that he never in any city indulged in amatory
excesses, or in unreasonable drinking parties and revels."</p>

<p>62. But luxury and extravagance were so very much practised among the
ancients, that even Parrhasius the painter always wore a purple robe,
and a golden crown on his head, as Clearchus relates, in his Lives: for
he, being most immoderately luxurious, and also to a degree beyond what
was becoming to a painter, laid claim, in words, to great virtue, and
inscribed upon the works which were done by him&mdash;</p>

  </div>
 </div>
</div>


<p>But some one else, being indignant at this inscription, wrote by the
side of it, ῥαβδοδίαιτος (worthy of a stick). Parrhasius also
put the following inscription on many of his works:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 870]</span></p>

<p>He also boasted, in a way which no one could be indignant at, in the
following lines:&mdash;</p>

<p>And once, at Samos, when he was contending with a very inferior
painter in a picture of Ajax, and was defeated, when his friends were
sympathising with him and expressing their indignation, he said that
he himself cared very little about it, but that he was sorry for Ajax,
who was thus defeated a second time. And so great was his luxury, that
he wore a purple robe, and a white turban on his head; and used to lean
on a stick, ornamented all round with golden fretted work: and he used
even to fasten the strings of his sandals with golden clasps. However,
as regarded his art, he was not churlish or ill-tempered, but affable
and good-humoured; so that he sang all the time that he was painting,
as Theophrastus relates, in his treatise on Happiness.</p>

<p>But once he spoke in a marvellous strain, more like a quack, when he
said, when he was painting the Hercules at Lindus, that the god had
appeared to him in a dream, in that form and dress which was the best
adapted for painting; on which account he inscribed on the picture&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">ARISTIPPUS.</div>

<p>63. We find also whole schools of philosophers which have openly
professed to have made choice of pleasure. And there is the school
called the Cyrenaic, which derives its origin from Aristippus the pupil
of Socrates: and he devoted himself to pleasure in such a way, that he
said that it was the main end of life; and that happiness was founded
on it, and that happiness was at best but short-lived. And he, like
the most debauched of men, thought that he had nothing to do either
with the recollection of past enjoyments, or with the hope of future
ones; but he judged of all good by the present alone, and thought that
having enjoyed, and being about to enjoy, did not at all concern him;
since the one case had no longer any existence, and the other did not
yet exist and was necessarily uncertain: acting in this respect like

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 871]</span>

thoroughly dissolute men, who are content with being prosperous at the
present moment. And his life was quite consistent with his theory; for
he spent the whole of it in all kinds of luxury and extravagance, both
in perfumes, and dress, and women. Accordingly, he openly kept Lais as
his mistress; and he delighted in all the extravagance of Dionysius,
although he was often treated insultingly by him.</p>
<p>Accordingly, Hegesander says that once, when he was assigned a very
mean place at a banquet by Dionysius, he endured it patiently; and when
Dionysius asked him what he thought of his present place, in comparison
of his yesterday's seat, he said, "That the one was much the same as
the other; for that one," says he, "is a mean seat to-day, because it
is deprived of me; but it was yesterday the most respectable seat in
the room, owing to me: and this one to-day has become respectable,
because of my presence in it; but yesterday it was an inglorious
seat, as I was not present in it." And in another place Hegesander
says&mdash;"Aristippus, being ducked with water by Dionysius's servants,
and being ridiculed by Antiphon for bearing it patiently, said, 'But
suppose I had been out fishing, and got wet, was I to have left my
employment, and come away?'" And Aristippus sojourned a considerable
time in Ægina, indulging in every kind of luxury; on which account
Xenophon says in his Memorabilia, that Socrates often reproved him, and
invented the apologue of Virtue and Pleasure to apply it to him. And
Aristippus said, respecting Lais, "I have her, and I am not possessed
by her." And when he was at the court of Dionysius, he once had a
quarrel with some people about a choice of three women. And he used to
wash with perfumes, and to say that&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">THE PERSIAN.</div>

<p>64. And Aristoxenus the musician, in his Life of Archytas, represents
ambassadors as having been sent by Dionysius the younger to the city
of the Tarentines, among whom was Polyarchus, who was surnamed the
Luxurious, a man wholly devoted to sensual pleasures, not only in deed,
but in word and profession also. And he was a friend of Archytas, and
not wholly unversed in philosophy; and so he used to come with him
into the sacred precincts, and to walk with him and with his friends,
listening to his lectures and arguments: and once, when there was a
long dispute and discussion about the passions, and altogether about
sensual pleasures, Polyarchus said&mdash;"I, indeed, my friends, have often
considered the matter, and it has seemed to me that this system of the
virtues is altogether a long way removed from nature; for nature, when
it utters its own voice, orders one to follow pleasure, and says that
this is the conduct of a wise man: but that to oppose it, and to bring
one's appetites into a state of slavery, is neither the part of a wise
man, nor of a fortunate man, nor indeed of one who has any accurate
understanding of what the constitution of human nature really is. And
it is a strong proof of this, that all men, when they have acquired
any power worth speaking of, betake themselves to sensual pleasures,
and think the power of indulging them the principal advantage to be
gained from the possession of power, and everything else, so to say,
as unimportant and superfluous. And we may adduce the example of the
Persian king at present, and every other tyrant possessed of any power
worth speaking of,&mdash;and in former times, the sovereigns of the Lydians
and of the Medes,&mdash;and even in earlier times still, the tyrants of the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 873]</span>

Syrians behaved in the same manner; for all these men left no kind of
pleasure unexplored: and it is even said that rewards were offered by
the Persians to any one who was able to invent a new pleasure. And it
was a very wise offer to make; for the nature of man is soon satiated
with long-continued pleasures, even if they be of a very exquisite
nature. So that, since novelty has a very great effect in making a
pleasure appear greater, we must not despise it, but rather pay great
attention to it. And on this account it is that many different kinds
of dishes have been invented, and many sorts of sweetmeats; and many
discoveries have been made in the articles of incenses and perfumes,
and clothes, and beds, and, above all, of cups and other articles of
furniture. For all these things contribute some amount of pleasure,
when the material which is admired by human nature is properly
employed: and this appears to be the case with gold and silver, and
with most things which are pleasing to the eye and also rare, and with
all things which are elaborated to a high degree of perfection by
manual arts and skill."</p>

<p>65. And having discussed after this all the attendance with which the
king of the Persians is surrounded, and what a number of servants he
has, and what their different offices are, and also about his amorous
indulgences, and also about the sweet perfume of his skin, and his
personal beauty, and the way in which he lives among his friends, and
the pleasing sights or sounds which are sought out to gratify him, he
said that he considered "the king of Persia the happiest of all men
now alive. For there are pleasures prepared for him which are both
most numerous and most perfect in their kind. And next to him," said
he, "any one may fairly rank our sovereign, though he falls far short
of the king of Persia. For this latter has all Asia to supply him
with luxury, but the store which supplies Dionysius will seem very
contemptible if compared with his. That, then, such a life as his is
worth struggling for, is plain from what has happened. For the Medes,
after encountering the greatest dangers, deprived the Syrians of the
supremacy, for no other object except to possess themselves of the
unrestrained licence of the Syrians. And the Persians overthrew the
Medes for the same reason, namely, in order to have an unrestrained
enjoyment of sensual pleasures. And the lawgivers who wish the
whole race of men to be on an equality, and that no citizens shall

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 874]</span>

indulge in superfluous luxury, have made some species of virtue hold
its head up. And they have written laws about contracts and other
matters of the same kind, and whatever appeared to be necessary for
political communion, and also with respect to dress, and to all the
other circumstances of life, that they should be similar among all
the citizens. And so, as all the lawgivers made war upon every kind
of covetousness, then first the praises of justice began to be more
thought of: and one of the poets spoke of&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse">The golden eye of justice.</div>

<p>And the very name of justice came to be accounted divine, so that in
some countries there were altars erected and sacrifices instituted to
Justice. And next to this they inculcated a respect for modesty and
temperance, and called an excess in enjoyment covetousness; so that a
man who obeyed the laws and was influenced by the common conversation
of men in general, was necessarily moderate with respect to sensual
pleasures."</p>

<p>66. And Duris says, in the twenty-third volume of his History, that in
ancient times the nobles had a positive fondness for getting drunk. On
which account Homer represents Achilles as reproaching Agamemnon, and
saying&mdash;</p>

<p>pointing out that his death was partly caused by his fondness for
drunkenness.</p>

<p>Speusippus also, the relation of Plato, and his successor in his
school, was a man very fond of pleasure. At all events Dionysius, the
tyrant of Sicily, in his letter to him blaming him for his fondness for
pleasure, reproaches him also for his covetousness, and for his love of
Lasthenea the Arcadian, who had been a pupil of Plato.</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">EPICURUS.</div>

<p>67. But not only did Aristippus and his followers embrace
that pleasure which consists in motion, but also Epicurus and his
followers did the same. And not to say anything of those sudden
motions, and irritations, and titillations, and also those prickings
and stimuli which Epicurus often brings forward, I will merely cite
what he has said in his treatise on the End. For he says&mdash;"For I
am not able to perceive any good, if I take away all the pleasures
which arise from flavours, and if I leave out of the question all
the pleasures arising from amorous indulgences, and all those which
are caused by hearing sweet sounds, and all those motions which are
excited by figures which are pleasant to the sight." And Metrodorus
in his Epistles says&mdash;"My good natural philosopher Timocrates, reason
which proceeds according to nature devotes its whole attention to the
stomach." And Epicurus says&mdash;"The origin and root of all good is the
pleasure of the stomach; and all excessive efforts of wisdom have
reference to the stomach." And again, in his treatise concerning the
End, he says&mdash;"You ought therefore to respect honour and the virtues,
and all things of that sort, if they produce pleasure; but if they do
not, then we may as well have nothing to do with them:" evidently in
these words making virtue subordinate to pleasure, and performing as
it were the part of a handmaid to it. And in another place he says&mdash;"I
spit upon honour, and those who worship it in a foolish manner, when it
produces no pleasure."</p>

<p>68. Well then did the Romans, who are in every respect the most
admirable of men, banish Alcius and Philiscus the Epicureans out
of their city, when Lucius Postumius was consul, on account of the
pleasures which they sought to introduce into the city. And in the same
manner the Messenians by a public decree banished the Epicureans. But
Antiochus the king banished all the philosophers out of his kingdom,
writing thus&mdash;"King Antiochus to Phanias: We have written to
you before, that no philosopher is to remain in the city, nor in the
country. But we hear that there is no small number of them, and that
they do great injury to the young men, because you have done none of
the things about which we wrote to you. As soon, therefore, as you
receive this letter, order a proclamation to be made, that all the
philosophers do at once depart from those places, and that as many

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 876]</span>

young men as are detected in going to them, shall be fastened to a
pillar and flogged, and their fathers shall be held in great blame. And
let not this order be transgressed."</p>

<p>But before Epicurus, Sophocles the poet was a great instigator to
pleasure, speaking as follows in his Antigone<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>69. "And Lycon the Peripatetic," as Antigonus the Carystian says,
"when as a young man he had come to Athens for the sake of his
education, was most accurately informed about everything relating to
banquets and drinking parties, and as to how much pay every courtesan
required. But afterwards having become the chief man of the Peripatetic
school, he used to entertain his friends at banquets with excessive
arrogance and extravagance. For, besides the music which was provided
at his entertainments, and the silver plate and coverlets which were
exhibited, all the rest of the preparation and the superb character
of the dishes was such, and the multitude of tables and cooks was so
great, that many people were actually alarmed, and, though they wished
to be admitted into his school, shrunk back, fearing to enter, as into
a badly governed state, which was always burdening its citizens with
liturgies and other expensive offices.</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">ANAXARCHUS.</div>

<p>For men were compelled to undertake the regular office of chief of the
Peripatetic school. And the duties of this office were, to superintend
all the novices for thirty days, and see that they conducted themselves
with regularity. And then, on the last day of the month, having
received nine obols from each of the novices, he received at supper not
only all those who contributed their share, but all those also whom
Lycon might chance to invite, and also all those of the elders who were
diligent in attending the school; so that the money which was collected
was not sufficient even for providing sufficient unguents and garlands.
He also was bound to perform the sacrifices, and to become an overseer
of the Muses. All which

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 877]</span>

duties appeared to have but little connexion with reason or with
philosophy, but to be more akin to luxury and parade. For if any people
were admitted who were not able to spend money on these objects, they,
setting out with a very scanty and ordinary choregia . . . . and the money
was very much out of proportion . . . . For Plato and Speusippus had not
established these entertainments, in order that people might dwell upon
the pleasures of the table from daybreak, or for the sake of getting
drunk; but in order that men might appear to honour the Deity, and to
associate with one another in a natural manner; and chiefly with a view
to natural relaxation and conversation; all which things afterwards
became in their eyes second to the softness of their garments, and
to their indulgence in their before-mentioned extravagance. Nor do
I except the rest. For Lycon, to gratify his luxurious and insolent
disposition, had a room large enough to hold twenty couches, in the
most frequented part of the city, in Conon's house, which was well
adapted for him to give parties in. And Lycon was a skilful and clever
player at ball."</p>

<p>70. And of Anaxarchus, Clearchus the Solensian writes, in the fifth
book of his Lives, in the following manner&mdash;"Anaxarchus, who was one of
those who called themselves Eudæmonici, after he had become a rich man
through the folly of those men who supplied him with means out of their
abundance, used to have a naked full-grown damsel for his cup-bearer,
who was superior in beauty to all her fellows; she, if one is to look
at the real truth, thus exposing the intemperance of all those who
employed her. And his baker used to knead the dough wearing gloves
on his hands, and a cover on his mouth, to prevent any perspiration
running off his hands, and also to prevent him from breathing on his
cakes while he was kneading them." So that a man might fairly quote to
this wise philosopher the verses of Anaxilas the lyric poet&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse"> And anointing one's skin with a gold-colour'd ointment,</div>

<p>71. But how far superior to these men is Gorgias the Leontine; of
whom the same Clearchus says, in the eighth book of his Lives, that
because of the temperance of his life he lived nearly eighty years in
the full possession of all his intellect and faculties. And when some
one asked him what his system had been which had caused him to live
with such comfort, and to retain such full possession of his senses,
he said, "I have never done anything merely for the sake of pleasure."
But Demetrius of Byzantium, in the fourth book of his treatise on
Poems, says&mdash;"Gorgias the Leontine, being once asked by some one what
was the cause of his living more than a hundred years, said that it
was because he had never done anything to please any one else except
himself." And Ochus, after he had had a long enjoyment of kingly power,
and of all the other things which make life pleasant, being asked
towards the close of his life by his eldest son, by what course of
conduct he had preserved the kingly power for so many years, that he
also might imitate it; replied, "By behaving justly towards all men and
all gods." And Carystius of Pergamus, in his Historical Commentaries,
says&mdash;"Cephisodorus the Theban relates that Polydorus the physician of
Teos used to live with Antipater; and that the king had a common kind
of coarse carpet worked in rings like a counterpane, on which he used
to recline; and brazen bowls and only a small number of cups; for that
he was a man fond of plain living and averse to luxury."</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">PTOLEMY EUERGETES.</div>

<p>72. But the story which we have of Tithonus represents him as a person
sleeping from daybreak to sunset, so that his appetites scarcely
awakened him by evening. On which account he was said to sleep with
Aurora, because he was so wholly enslaved by his appetites. And as he
was at a later period of life prevented from indulging them by old
age, and being wholly dependent on them.... And Melanthius, stretching
out his neck, was choked by his enjoyments, being a greater glutton
than the Melanthius of Ulysses. And many other men have destroyed
their bodily strength entirely by their unreasonable indulgence; and
some have become inordinately fat; and others have become stupid
and insensible by reason of their inordinate luxury. Accordingly,
Nymphis of Heraclea, in the second book of his History

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 879]</span>

of Heraclea, says&mdash;"Dionysius the son of Clearchus, who was the
first tyrant of Heraclea, and who was himself afterwards tyrant of
his country, grew enormously fat without perceiving it, owing to his
luxury and to his daily gluttony; so that on account of his obesity he
was constantly oppressed by a difficulty of breathing and a feeling
of suffocation. On which account his physicians ordered thin needles
of an exceedingly great length to be made, to be run into his sides
and chest whenever he fell into a deeper sleep than usual. And up to a
certain point his flesh was so callous by reason of the fat, that it
never felt the needles; but if ever they touched a part that was not so
overloaded, then he felt them, and was awakened by them. And he used
to give answers to people who came to him, holding a chest in front of
his body so as to conceal all the rest of his person, and leave only
his face visible; and in this condition he conversed with those who
came to him." And Menander also, who was a person as little given to
evil-speaking as possible, mentions him in his Fishermen, introducing
some exiles from Heraclea as saying&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse">For a fat pig was lying on his face;</div>

    <div class="verse">He gave himself to luxury so wholly,</div>
    <div class="verse">That he could not last long to practise it;</div>

<p>And he died when he was fifty-five years of age, of which he had
been tyrant thirty-three,&mdash;being superior to all the tyrants who had
preceded him in gentleness and humanity.</p>

<p>73. And Ptolemy the Seventh, king of Egypt, was a man of this sort, the
same who caused himself to be styled Euergetes,<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
but who was called Cacergetes by the Alexandrians. Accordingly,
Posidonius the Stoic, who went with Scipio Africanus when he was sent
to Alexandria, and who there saw this Ptolemy, writes thus, in the
seventh book of his History,&mdash;"But owing to his luxury his whole
body was eaten up with fat, and with the greatness of his belly, which

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 880]</span>

was so large that no one could put his arms all round it; and he wore
over it a tunic which reached down to his feet, having sleeves which
reached to his wrists, and he never by any chance walked out except on
this occasion of Scipio's visit." And that this king was not averse
to luxury, he tells us when he speaks of himself, relating, in the
eighth book of his Commentaries, how he was priest of Apollo at Cyrene,
and how he gave a banquet to those who had been priests before him;
writing thus:&mdash;"The Artemitia is the great festival of Cyrene, on which
occasion the priest of Apollo (and that office is one which lasts a
year) gives a banquet to all those who have been his predecessors in
the office; and he sets before each of them a separate dish. And this
dish is an earthenware vessel, holding about twenty artabæ,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
in which there are many kinds of game elaborately dressed, and many
kinds of bread, and of tame birds, and of sea-fish, and also many
species of foreign preserved meats and pickled fish. And very often
some people also furnish them with a handsome youth as an attendant.
But we ourselves omitted all this, and instead we furnished them with
cups of solid silver, each being of as much value as all the things
which we have just enumerated put together; and also we presented each
man with a horse properly harnessed, and a groom, and gilt trappings;
and we invited each man to mount his horse and ride him home."</p>

<p>His son Alexander also became exceedingly fat, the one, I mean, who
put his mother to death who had been his partner in the kingdom.
Accordingly Posidonius, in the forty-seventh book of his History,
mentions him in the following terms:&mdash;"But the king of Egypt being
detested by the multitude, but flattered by the people whom he had
about him, and living in great luxury, was not able even to walk,
unless he went leaning on two friends; but for all that he would, at
his banquets, leap off from a high couch, and dance bare-foot with more
vigour than even those who made dancing their profession."</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">THE LACEDÆMONIANS.</div>

<p>74. And Agatharchides, in the sixteenth book of his History of Europe,
says that Magas, who was king of Cyrene for fifty years, and who never
had any wars, but spent all his
time in luxury, became, towards the end of his life, so

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 881]</span>

immensely bulky and burdensome to himself, that he was at last actually
choked by his fat, from the inactivity of his body, and the enormous
quantity of food which he consumed. But among the Lacedæmonians, the
same man relates, in his twenty-seventh book, that it is thought a
proof of no ordinary infamy if any one is of an unmanly appearance,
or if any one appears at all inclined to have a large belly; as the
young men are exhibited naked before the ephori every ten days. And the
ephori used every day to take notice both of the clothes and bedding
of the young men; and very properly. For the cooks at Lacedæmon were
employed solely on dressing meat plainly, and on nothing else. And in
his twenty-seventh book, Agatharchides says that the Lacedæmonians
brought Nauclides, the son of Polybiades, who was enormously fat in
his body, and who had become of a vast size through luxury, into
the middle of the assembly; and then, after Lysander had publicly
reproached him as an effeminate voluptuary, they nearly banished him
from the city, and threatened him that they would certainly do so
if he did not reform his life; on which occasion Lysander said that
Agesilaus also, when he was in the country near the Hellespont, making
war against the barbarians, seeing the Asiatics very expensively
clothed, but utterly useless in their bodies, ordered all who were
taken prisoners, to be stripped naked and sold by the auctioneer; and
after that he ordered their clothes to be sold without them; in order
that the allies, knowing that they had to fight for a great prize,
and against very contemptible men, might advance with greater spirit
against their enemies. And Python the orator, of Byzantium, as Leon,
his fellow-citizen, relates, was enormously fat; and once, when the
Byzantians were divided against one another in seditious quarrels, he,
exhorting his fellow-citizens to unanimity, said&mdash;"You see, my friends,
what a size my body is; but I have a wife who is much fatter than I am;
now, when we are both agreed, one small bed is large enough for both of
us; but when we quarrel, the whole house is not big enough for us."</p>

<p>75. How much better, then, is it, my good friend Timocrates, to be
poor and thinner than even those men whom Hermippus mentions in his
Cercopes, than to be enormously rich, and like that whale of Tanagra,
as the before-mentioned men were! But Hermippus uses the following
language, addressing Bacchus on the present occasion&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">CINESIAS.</div>

<p>76. And Cinesias was in reality an exceedingly tall and exceedingly
thin man; on whom Strattis wrote an entire play, calling him the
Phthian Achilles, because in his own poetry he was constantly using the
word φθιῶτα. And accordingly, he, playing on his appearance,
continually addresses him&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Φθιῶτ' Ἀχιλλεῦ. &mdash;</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>But others, as, for instance, Aristophanes, often call him
φιλύρινος Κινησίας, because he took a plank of linden wood (φιλύρα),

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 883]</span>

and fastened it to his waist under his girdle, in order to
avoid stooping, because of his great height and extreme thinness. But
that Cinesias was a man of delicate health, and badly off in other
respects, we are told by Lysias the orator, in his oration inscribed,
"For Phanias accused of illegal Practices," in which he says that he,
having abandoned his regular profession, had taken to trumping up false
accusations against people, and to making money by such means. And that
he means the poet here, and no one else, is plain from the fact that he
shows also that he had been attacked by the comic poets for impiety.
And he also, in the oration itself, shows that he was a person of that
character. And the words of the orator are as follows:&mdash;"But I marvel
that you are not indignant at such a man as Cinesias coming forward
in aid of the laws, whom you all know to be the most impious of all
men, and the greatest violater of the laws that has ever existed. Is
not he the man who has committed such offences against the gods as all
other men think it shameful even to speak of, though you hear the comic
poets mention such actions of his every year? Did not Apollophanes, and
Mystalides, and Lysitheus feast with him, selecting one of the days on
which it was not lawful to hold a feast, giving themselves the name
of Cacodæmonistæ,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
instead of Numeniastæ, a name indeed appropriate enough to their
fortunes? Nor, indeed, did it occur to them that they were really doing
what that name denotes; but they acted in this manner to show their
contempt for the gods and for our laws. And accordingly, each of those
men perished, as it was reasonable to expect that such men should.</p>

<p>"But this man, with whom you are all acquainted, the gods have treated
in such a manner, that his very enemies would rather that he should
live than die, as an example to all other men, that they may see that
the immortal Gods do not postpone the punishment due to men who behave
insolently towards their Deity, so as to reserve it for their children;
but that they destroy the men themselves in a miserable manner,
inflicting on them greater and more terrible calamities and diseases
than on any other men whatever. For to die, or to be afflicted with
sickness in an ordinary manner, is the common lot of all of us; but

to be in such a condition as they are reduced to, and to
remain a long time in such a state, and to be dying every day, and yet
not be able to end one's life, is a punishment allotted to men who act
as this man has acted, in defiance of all human and divine law." And
this orator used this language respecting Cinesias.</p>

<p>77. Philetas also, the Coan poet, was a very thin man; so that, by
reason of the leanness of his body, he used to wear balls made of lead
fastened to his feet, to prevent himself from being blown over by the
wind. And Polemo, surnamed Periegetes, in his treatise on Wonderful
People and Things, says that Archestratus the soothsayer, being taken
prisoner by the enemy, and being put into the scale, was found to
weigh only one obol, so very thin was he. The same man also relates
that Panaretus never had occasion to consult a physician, but that he
used to be a pupil of Arcesilaus the philosopher; and that he was a
companion of Ptolemy Euergetes, receiving from him a salary of twelve
talents every year. And he was the thinnest of men, though he never had
any illness all his life.</p>

<p>But Metrodorus the Scepsian, in the second book of his treatise on
the Art of Training, says that Hipponax the poet was not only very
diminutive in person, but also very thin; and that he, nevertheless,
was so strong in his sinews, that, among other feats of strength, he
could throw an empty oil cruise an extraordinary distance, although
light bodies are not easy to be propelled violently, because they
cannot cut the air so well. Philippides, also, was extremely thin,
against whom there is an oration extant of Hyperides the orator, who
says that he was one of those men who governed the state. And he
was very insignificant in appearance by reason of his thinness, as
Hyperides has related. And Alexis, in his Thesprotians, said&mdash;</p>

<p>79. And Clearchus the Solensian, in his treatise on Love Matters,
says&mdash;"Why is it that we carry in our hands flowers, and apples, and
things of that sort? Is it that by our delight in these things nature
points out those of us who have a desire for all kinds of beauty? Is
it, therefore, as a kind of specimen of beauty that men carry beautiful
things in their hands, and take delight in them? Or do they carry
them about for two objects? For by these means the beginning
of good fortune, and an indication of one's wishes, is to a

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 887]</span>

certain extent secured; to those who are asked for them, by their
being addressed, and to those who give them, because they give an
intimation beforehand, that they must give of their beauty in exchange.
For a request for beautiful flowers and fruits, intimates that those
who receive them are prepared to give in return the beauty of their
persons. Perhaps also people are fond of those things, and carry
them about them in order to comfort and mitigate the vexation which
arises from the neglect or absence of those whom they love. For by
the presence of these agreeable objects, the desire for those persons
whom we love is blunted; unless, indeed, we may rather say that it is
for the sake of personal ornament that people carry those things, and
take delight in them, just as they wear anything else which tends to
ornament. For not only those people who are crowned with flowers, but
those also who carry them in their hands, find their whole appearance
is improved by them. Perhaps also, people carry them simply because
of their love for any beautiful object. For the love of beautiful
objects shows that we are inclined to be fond of the productions of the
seasons.</p>

<p>For the face of spring and autumn is really beautiful, when looked at
in their flowers and fruits. And all persons who are in love, being
made, as it were, luxurious by their passion, and inclined to admire
beauty, are softened by the sight of beauty of any sort. For it is
something natural that people who fancy that they themselves are
beautiful and elegant, should be fond of flowers; on which account the
companions of Proserpine are represented as gathering flowers. And
Sappho says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>80. But in former times men were so devoted to luxury, that they
dedicated a temple to Venus Callipyge on this account. A certain
countryman had two beautiful daughters; and they once, contending with
one another, went into the public roads, disputing as they went, which
had the most beautiful buttocks. And as a young man was passing, who
had an aged father, they showed themselves to him also. And he, when
he had seen both, decided in favour of the elder; and falling in love
with her, he returned into the city and fell ill, and took to his bed,
and related what had happened to his brother, who was younger than he;
and he also, going into the fields and seeing the damsels himself,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 888]</span>

fell in love with the other. Accordingly, their father, when with all
his exhortations he could not persuade his sons to think of a higher
marriage, brings these damsels to them out of the fields, having
persuaded their father to give them to him, and marries them to his
sons. And they were always called the καλλίπνγοι; as Cercidas
of Megalopolis says in his Iambics, in the following line&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">There was a pair of καλλίπνγοι women</div>
    <div class="verse">At Syracuse.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>So they, having now become rich women, built a temple to Venus, calling
the goddess καλλίπνγος, as Archelaus also relates in his
Iambics.</p>

<p>And that the luxury of madness is exceedingly great is very pleasantly
argued by Heraclides of Pontus, in his treatise on Pleasure, where
he says&mdash;"Thrasylaus the Æxonensian, the son of Pythodorus, was once
afflicted with such violent madness, that he thought that all the
vessels which came to the Piræus belonged to him. And he entered them
in his books as such; and sent them away, and regulated their affairs
in his mind, and when they returned to port he received them with great
joy, as a man might be expected to who was master of so much wealth.
And when any were lost, he never inquired about them, but he rejoiced
in all that arrived safe; and so he lived with great pleasure. But when
his brother Crito returned from Sicily, and took him and put him into
the hands of a doctor, and cured him of his madness, he himself related
his madness, and said that he had never been happier in his life; for
that he never felt any grief, but that the quantity of pleasure which
he experienced was something unspeakable."</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Antiphanes</span> the comic writer, my friend Timocrates, when he was
reading one of his own comedies to Alexander the king, and when it was
plain that the king did not think much of it, said to him, "The fact
is, O king, that a man who is to appreciate this play, ought to have
often supped at picnic feasts, and must have often borne and inflicted

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 889]</span>

blows in the cause of courtesans," as Lycophron the Chalcidian relates
in his treatise on Comedy. And accordingly we, who are now about to
set out a discussion on amatory matters, (for there was a good deal of
conversation about married women and about courtesans,) saying what we
have to say to people who understand the subject, invoking the Muse
Erato to be so good as to impress anew on our memory that amatory
catalogue, will make our commencement from this point&mdash;</p>

<p>what it was that was said by the different guests about love and about
amatory matters.</p>

<p>2. For our admirable host, praising the married women, said that
Hermippus stated in his book about lawgivers, that at Lacedæmon all the
damsels used to be shut up in a dark room, while a number of unmarried
young men were shut up with them; and whichever girl each of the young
men caught hold of he led away as his wife, without a dowry. On which
account they punished Lysander, because he left his former wife, and
wished to marry another who was by far more beautiful. But Clearchus
the Solensian, in his treatise on Proverbs, says,&mdash;"In Lacedæmon the
women, on a certain festival, drag the unmarried men to an altar, and
then buffet them; in order that, for the purpose of avoiding the insult
of such treatment, they may become more affectionate, and in due season
may turn their thoughts to marriage. But at Athens, Cecrops was the
first person who married a man to one wife only, when before his time
connexions had taken place at random, and men had had their wives in
common. On which account it was, as some people state, that Cecrops was
called διφυὴς,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
because before his time people did not know who their fathers were, by
reason of the numbers of men who might have been so."</p>

<p>And beginning in this manner, one might fairly blame those who
attributed to Socrates two wives, Xanthippe and Myrto, the daughter of
Aristides; not of that Aristides who was surnamed the Just, (for the
time does not agree,) but of his descendant in the third generation.
And the men who made this statement are Callisthenes, and Demetrius
Phalereus, and Satyrus the Peripatetic, and Aristoxenus; who were
preceded in it by Aristotle, who relates the same story in his

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 890]</span>

treatise on Nobleness of Birth. Unless perhaps this licence was allowed
by a decree at that time on account of the scarcity of men, so that any
one who pleased might have two wives; to which it must be owing that
the comic poets make no mention of this fact, though they very often
mention Socrates. And Hieronymus of Rhodes has cited the decree about
wives; which I will send to you, since I have the book. But Panætius
the Rhodian has contradicted those who make this statement about the
wives of Socrates.</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">HERCULES.</div>

<p>3. But among the Persians the queen tolerates the king's having a
number of concubines, because there the king rules his wife like her
master; and also because the queen, as Dinon states in his history
of Persia, receives a great deal of respect from the concubines. At
all events they offer her adoration. And Priam, too, had a great many
women, and Hecuba was not indignant. Accordingly, Priam says&mdash;</p>

<p>But among the Greeks, the mother of Phœnix does not tolerate the
concubine of Amyntor. And Medea, although well acquainted with the
fashion, as one well established among the barbarians, refuses to
tolerate the marriage of Glauce, having been forsooth already initiated
in better and Greek habits. And Clytæmnestra, being exceedingly
indignant at a similar provocation, slays Cassandra with Agamemnon
himself, whom the monarch brought with him into Greece, having given
in to the fashion of barbarian marriages. "And a man may wonder,"
says Aristotle, "that Homer has nowhere in the Iliad represented any
concubine as living with Menelaus, though he has given wives to every
one else. And accordingly, in Homer, even old men sleep with women,
such as Nestor and Phœnix. For these men were not worn out or disabled
in the time of their youth, either by intoxication, or by too much
indulgence in love; or by any weakness of digestion engendered by
gluttony; so that it was natural for them to be still vigorous in old
age. The king of Sparta, then, appears to have too much respect for
his wedded wife Helena, on whose account he collected all the Grecian
army; and on this account he keeps aloof from any

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 891]</span>

other connexion. But Agamemnon is reproached by Thersites, as a man
with many wives&mdash;</p>

<p>'Tis thine, whate'er the warrior's breast inflames, The golden spoil,
and thine the lovely dames; With all the wealth our wars and blood
bestow, Thy tents are crowded and thy chests o'erflow.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>"But it is not natural," says Aristotle, "to suppose that all that
multitude of female slaves were given to him as concubines, but only
as prizes; since he also provided himself with a great quantity of
wine,&mdash;but not for the purpose of getting drunk himself."</p>

<p>4. But Hercules is the man who appears to have had more wives than
any one else, for he was very much addicted to women; and he had
them in turn, like a soldier, and a man employed at different times
in different countries. And by them he had also a great multitude of
children. For, in one week, as Herodorus relates, he relieved the fifty
daughters of Thestias of their virginity. Ægeus also was a man of many
wives. For, first of all he married the daughter of Hoples, and after
her he married one of the daughters of Chalcodous, and giving both of
them to his friends, he cohabited with a great many without marriage.
Afterwards he took Æthra, the daughter of Pittheus; after her he took
Medea. And Theseus, having attempted to ravish Helen, after that
carried off Ariadne. Accordingly Istrus, in the fourteenth book of his
History of the Affairs of Athens, giving a catalogue of those women who
became the wives of Theseus, says that some of them became so out of
love, and that some were carried off by force, and some were married in
legal marriage. Now by force were ravished Helen, Ariadne, Hippolyta,
and the daughters of Cercyon and Sinis; and he legally married Melibœa,
the mother of Ajax. And Hesiod says that he married also Hippe and
Ægle; on account of whom he broke the oaths which he had sworn to
Ariadne, as Cercops tells us. And Pherecydes adds Pherebœa. And before
ravishing Helen he had also carried off Anaxo from Troy; and after
Hippolyta he also had Phædra.</p>

<p>5. And Philip the Macedonian did not take any women with him to his
wars, as Darius did, whose power was subverted by Alexander. For he

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 892]</span>

used to take about with him
three hundred and fifty concubines in all his wars; as Dicæearchus
relates in the third book of his Life in Greece. "But Philip," says
he, "was always marrying new wives in war time. For, in the twenty-two
years which he reigned, as Satyrus relates in his History of his Life,
having married Audata the Illyrian, he had by her a daughter named
Cynna; and he also married Phila, a sister of Derdas and Machatas. And
wishing to conciliate the nation of the Thessalians, he had children
by two Thessalian women; one of whom was Nicesipolis of Pheræ, who
brought him a daughter named Thessalonica; and the other was Philenora
of Larissa, by whom he had Aridæus. He also acquired the kingdom of
the Molossi, when he married Olympias, by whom he had Alexander and
Cleopatra. And when he subdued Thrace, there came to him Cithelas, the
king of the Thracians, bringing with him Meda his daughter, and many
presents: and having married her, he added her to Olympias. And after
all these, being violently in love, he married Cleopatra, the sister
of Hippostratus and niece of Attalus. And bringing her also home to
Olympias, he made all his life unquiet and troubled. For, as soon as
this marriage took place, Attalus said, 'Now, indeed, legitimate kings
shall be born, and not bastards.' And Alexander having heard this,
smote Attalus with a goblet which he had in his hand; and Attalus in
return struck him with his cup. And after that Olympias fled to the
Molossi; and Alexander fled to the Illyrians. And Cleopatra bore to
Philip a daughter who was named Europa."</p>

<p>Euripides the poet, also, was much addicted to women: at all events
Hieronymus in his Historical Commentaries speaks as follows,&mdash;"When
some one told Sophocles that Euripides was a woman-hater, 'He may be,'
said he, 'in his tragedies, but in his bed he is very fond of women.'"</p>

<p>10. And I do not think that any of you are ignorant, my friends, that
the greatest wars have taken place on account of women:&mdash;the Trojan war
on account of Helen; the plague which took place in it was on account
of Chryseis; the anger of Achilles was excited about Briseis; and the
war called the Sacred War, on account of another wife (as Duris relates
in the second book of his History), who was a Theban by birth, by name
Theano, and who was carried off by some Phocian. And this war also
lasted ten years, and in the tenth year was brought to an end by the
cooperation of Philip; for by his aid the Thebans took Phocis.</p>

<p>The war, also, which is called the Crissæan War (as Callisthenes
tells us in his account of the Sacred War), when the Crissæans made
war upon the Phocians, lasted ten years; and it was excited on this
account,&mdash;because the Crissæans carried off Megisto, the daughter of
Pelagon the Phocian, and the daughters of the Argives, as they were
returning from the Pythian temple: and in the tenth year Crissa was
taken. And whole families also have been ruined owing to women;&mdash;for
instance, that of Philip, the father of Alexander, was ruined on
account of his marriage with Cleopatra; and Hercules was ruined by his
marriage with Iole, the daughter of Eurytus; and Theseus on account
of his marriage with Phædra, the daughter of Minos; and Athamas on
account of his marriage with Themisto, the daughter of Hypseus; and
Jason on account of his marriage with Glauce, the daughter of Creon;
and Agamemnon on account of Cassandra. And the expedition of Cambyses
against Egypt (as Ctesias relates) took place on account of a woman;
for Cambyses, having heard that Egyptian women were far more amorous
than other women, sent to Amasis the king of the Egyptians, asking him
for one of his daughters in marriage. But he did not give him one of
his own daughters, thinking that she would not be honoured as a wife,
but only treated as a concubine; but he sent him Nitetis, the daughter
of Apries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 897]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">LOVE.</div>

<p>And Apries had been deposed from the sovereignty of Egypt, because of
the defeats which had been received by him from the Cyreneans; and
afterwards he had been put to death by Amasis. Accordingly, Cambyses,
being much pleased with Nitetis, and being very violently in love
with her, learns the whole circumstances of the case from her; and
she entreated him to avenge the murder of Apries, and persuaded him
to make war upon the Egyptians. But Dinon, in his History of Persia,
and Lynceas of Naucratis, in the third book of his History of Egypt,
say that it was Cyrus to whom Nitetis was sent by Amasis; and that she
was the mother of Cambyses, who made this expedition against Egypt to
avenge the wrongs of his mother and her family. But Duris the Samian
says that the first war carried on by two women was that between
Olympias and Eurydice; in which Olympias advanced something in the
manner of a Bacchanalian, with drums beating; but Eurydice came forward
armed like a Macedonian soldier, having been already accustomed to war
and military habits at the court of Cynnane the Illyrian.</p>

<p>11. Now, after this conversation, it seemed good to the philosophers

<p>12. And Pontianus said that Zeno the Cittiæan thought that Love was the
God of Friendship and Liberty, and also that he was the great author of
concord among men; but that he had no other office. On which account,
he says in his Polity, that Love is a God, being one who cooperates
in securing the safety of the city. And the philosophers, also, who
preceded him considered Love a venerable Deity, removed from everything
discreditable: and this is plain from their having set up holy statues
in his honour in their Gymnasia, along with those of Mercury and
Hercules&mdash;the one of whom is the patron of eloquence, and the other
of valour. And when these are united, friendship and unanimity are
engendered; by means of which the most perfect liberty is secured to
those who excel in these practices. But the Athenians were so far
from thinking that Love presided over the gratification of the mere
sensual appetites, that, though the Academy was manifestly consecrated
to Minerva, they yet erected in that place also a statue of Love, and
sacrificed to it.</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">LOVE.</div>

<p>The Thespians also celebrate Erotidia, or festivals of Love, just as
the Athenians do Athenæa, or festivals of Minerva, and as the Eleans
celebrate the Olympian festivals, and the Rhodians the Halæan. And
in the public sacrifices, everywhere almost, Love is honoured. And
the Lacedæmonians offer sacrifices to Love before they go to battle,
thinking that safety and victory depend on the friendship of those who
stand side by side in the battle array. And the Cretans, in their line
of battle, adorn the handsomest of their citizens, and employ them to
offer sacrifices to Love on behalf of the state, as Sosicrates relates.
And the regiment among the Thebans which is called the Sacred Band, is
wholly composed of mutual lovers, indicating the majesty of the God, as
these men prefer a glorious death to a shameful and discreditable
life. But the Samians (as Erxias says, in his History of Colophon),
having consecrated a gymnasium to Love, called the festival which was
instituted in his honour the Eleutheria, or Feast of Liberty; and it
was owing to this God, too, that the Athenians obtained their freedom.
And the Pisistratidæ, after their banishment, were the first people
who ever endeavoured to throw discredit on the events which took place
through his influence.</p>

the most infamous passions (as Antigonus the Carystian relates, in
his History of his Life); for you are always saying that "the proper
object of love is not the body, but the mind;" you who say at the same
time, that you ought to remain faithful to the objects of your love,
till they are eight-and-twenty years of age. And Ariston of Ceos, the
Peripatetic, appears to me to have said very well (in the second book
of his treatise on Likenesses connected with Love), to some Athenian
who was very tall for his age, and at the same time was boasting of his
beauty, (and his name was Dorus,) "It seems to me that one may very

seasoned dishes, but not plain meats, or plainly dressed fish. And
accordingly, when seasoned dishes are wanting, no one willingly
eats either meat or fish; nor does any one desire meat which is raw
and unseasoned. For anciently men used to love boys (as Aristophon
relates); on which account it came to pass that the objects of their
love were called παιδικά. And it was with truth (as Clearchus

<p>18. But you prefer having all the objects of your love shaved and
hairless. And this custom of shaving the beard originated in the age of
Alexander, as Chrysippus tells us in the fourth book of his treatise on
The Beautiful and on Pleasure. And I think it will not be unseasonable
if I quote what he says; for he is an author of whom I am very fond, on
account of his great learning and his gentle good-humoured disposition.
And this is the language of the philosopher:&mdash;"The custom of shaving
the beard was introduced in the time of Alexander, for the people in
earlier times did not practise it; and Timotheus the flute-player used
to play on the flute having a very long beard. And at Athens they even
now remember that the man who first shaved his chin, (and he is not a
very ancient man indeed,) was given the surname of Κόρσης;<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
on which account Alexis says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Do you see any man whose beard has been</div>
    <div class="verse">Removed by sharp pitch-plasters or by razors?</div>
    <div class="verse">In one of these two ways he may be spoken of:</div>
    <div class="verse">Either he seems to me to think of war,</div>
    <div class="verse">And so to be rehearsing acts of fierce</div>
    <div class="verse">Hostility against his beard and chin;</div>
    <div class="verse">Or else he's some complaint of wealthy men.</div>
    <div class="verse">For how, I pray you, do your beards annoy you?&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse">Beards by which best you may be known as men?</div>
    <div class="verse">Unless, indeed, you're planning now some deed</div>
    <div class="verse">Unworthy of the character of men.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And Diogenes, when he saw some one once whose chin was smooth, said,
'I am afraid you think you have great ground to accuse nature, for
having made you a man and not a woman.' And once, when he saw another
man, riding a horse, who was shaved in the same manner, and perfumed
all over, and clothed, too, in a fashion corresponding to those
particulars, he said that he had often asked what a Ἱππόπορνος
was; and now he had found out. And at Rhodes, though there is a law
against shaving, still no one ever prosecutes another for doing so,
as the whole population is shaved. And at Byzantium, though there is
a penalty to which any barber is liable who is possessed of a razor,
still every one uses a razor none the less for that law." And this is
the statement of the admirable Chrysippus.</p>

rightly to enter into the spirit of his words, would become dirty and
ungentlemanlike-looking; just as those who adopted Aristippus's sect,
but perverted his precepts, became intemperate and shameless." And the
greater portion of you are such as that, men with contracted brows, and
dirty clothes, sordid not only in your dispositions, but also in your
appearance. For, wishing to assume the character of independence and
frugality, you are found at the gate of covetousness, living sordidly,
clothed in scanty cloaks, filling the soles of your shoes with nails,
and giving hard names to any one who uses the very smallest quantity
of perfume, or who is dressed in apparel which is at all delicate. But
men of your sect have no business to be attracted by money, or to lead

[at Athens] for the prize of manliness, they select the handsomest,
and give them the post of honour to bear the sacred vessels at the
festivals of the gods. And at Elis there is a contest as to beauty, and
the conqueror has the vessels of the goddess given to him to carry;
and the next handsomest has the ox to lead, and the third places the
sacrificial cakes on the head of the victim. But Heraclides Lembus
relates that in Sparta the handsomest man and the handsomest woman have
special honours conferred on them; and Sparta is famous for producing
the handsomest women in the world. On which account they tell a story
of king Archidamus, that when one wife was offered to him who was very
handsome, and another who was ugly but rich, and he chose the rich
one, the Ephori imposed a fine upon him, saying that he had preferred
begetting kinglings rather than kings for the Spartans. And Euripides

account. As even to this day that Æthiopian tribe called the Immortals
does; as Bion relates in his History of the Affairs of Æthiopia. For,
as it would seem, they consider beauty as the especial attribute of
kings. And goddesses have contended with one another respecting beauty;
and it was on account of his beauty that the gods carried off Ganymede
to be their cup-bearer&mdash;</p>

<p>And who are they whom the goddesses have carried off? are they not the
handsomest of men? And they cohabit with them; as Aurora does with
Cephalus and Clitus and Tithonus; and Ceres with Jason; and Venus with
Anchises and Adonis. And it was for the sake of beauty also that the
greatest of the gods entered through a roof under the form of gold, and
became a bull, and often transformed himself into a winged eagle, as he
did in the case of Ægina. And Socrates the philosopher, who despised
everything, was, for all that, subdued by the beauty of Alcibiades; as
also was the venerable Aristotle by the beauty of his pupil Phaselites.
And do not we too, even in the case of inanimate things, prefer what
is the most beautiful? The fashion, too, of Sparta is much praised, I
mean that of displaying their virgins naked to their guests; and in
the island of Chios it is a beautiful sight to go to the gymnasia and
the race-courses, and to see the young men wrestling naked with the
maidens, who are also naked.</p>

<p>21. And Cynulcus said:&mdash;And do you dare to talk in this way, you who
are not "rosy-fingered," as Cratinus says, but who have one foot made
of cow-dung? and do you bring up again the recollection of that poet
your namesake, who spends all his time in cookshops and inns? although
Isocrates the orator has said, in his Areopagitic Oration, "But not
one of their servants ever would have ventured to eat or drink in a
cookshop; for they studied to keep up the dignity of their appearance,
and not to behave like buffoons." And Hyperides, in his oration against
Patrocles, (if, at least, the speech is a genuine one,) says that
they forbade a man who had dined at a cookshop from going up to the
Areopagus. But you, you sophist, spend your time in cookshops, not
with your friends (ἑταίρων), but with prostitutes
(ἑταιρῶν), having a lot of pimps and procuresses about you, and always
carrying about these books of Aristophanes, and Apollodorus, and
Ammonius, and Antiphanes, and also of Gorgias the Athenian, who have
all written about the prostitutes at Athens.</p>

<p>Oh, what a learned man you are! how far are you from imitating
Theomandrus of Cyrene, who, as Theophrastus, in his treatise on
Happiness, says, used to go about and profess that he gave lessons
in prosperity. You, you teacher of love, are in no respect better
than Amasis of Elis, whom Theophrastus, in his treatise on Love, says
was extraordinarily addicted to amatory pursuits. And a man will
not be much out who calls you a πορνογράφος, just as they
call Aristides and Pausanias and Nicophanes ζωγράφοι. And
Polemo mentions them, as painting the subjects which they did paint
exceedingly well, in his treatise on the Pictures at Sicyon. Think, my
friends, of the great and varied learning of this grammarian, who does
not conceal what he means, but openly quotes the verses of Eubulus, in

<p>but I have been speaking of regular professional Hetæræ&mdash;that is to
say, of those who are able to preserve a friendship free from trickery;
whom Cynulcus does not venture to speak ill of, and who of all women
are the only ones who have derived their name from friendship,
or from that goddess who is named by the Athenians Venus Hetæra:
concerning whom Apollodorus the Athenian speaks, in his treatise on
the Gods, in the following manner:&mdash;"And they worship Venus Hetæra,
who brings together male and female companions (ἑταίρους καὶ ἑταίρας)&mdash;that is to say, mistresses." Accordingly, even to this day,
freeborn women and maidens call their associates and friends their
ἑταῖραι; as Sappho does, where she says&mdash;</p>

<p>They also call women who prostitute themselves for money,
ἑταῖραι. And the verb which they use for prostituting oneself
for money is ἑταιρέω, not regarding the etymology of the

<p>And Æschines the orator has said something of the same kind in his

  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>I know, too, that there is a festival called the Hetæridia, which is
celebrated in Magnesia, not owing to the courtesans, but to another
cause, which is mentioned by Hegesander in his Commentaries, who writes
thus:&mdash;"The Magnesians celebrate a festival called Hetæridia; and they
give this account of it: that originally Jason, the son of Æson, when
he had collected the Argonauts, sacrificed to Jupiter Hetærias, and
called the festival Hetæridia. And the Macedonian kings also celebrated
the Hetæridia."</p>

<p>There is also a temple of Venus the Prostitute (πόρνη) at
Abydus, as Pamphylus asserts:&mdash;"For when all the city was oppressed by
slavery, the guards in the city, after a sacrifice on one occasion (as
Cleanthus relates in his essays on Fables), having got intoxicated,
took several courtesans; and one of these women, when she saw that
the men were all fast asleep, taking the keys, got over the wall,
and brought the news to the citizens of Abydus. And they, on this,
immediately came in arms, and slew the guards, and made themselves
masters of the walls, and recovered their freedom; and to show
their gratitude to the prostitute they built a temple to Venus the
Prostitute."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 916]</span></p>

<p>And Alexis the Samian, in the second book of his Samian Annals,
says&mdash;"The Athenian prostitutes who followed Pericles when he laid
siege to Samos, having made vast sums of money by their beauty,
dedicated a statue of Venus at Samos, which some call Venus among the
Reeds, and others Venus in the Marsh." And Eualces, in his History of
the Affairs of Ephesus, says that there is at Ephesus also a temple to
Venus the Courtesan (ἑταῖρα). And Clearchus, in the first
book of his treatise on Amatory Matters, says&mdash;"Gyges the king of the
Lydians was very celebrated, not only on account of his mistress while
she was alive, having submitted himself and his whole dominions to her
power, but also after she was dead; inasmuch as he assembled all the
Lydians in the whole country, and raised that mound which is even now
called the tomb of the Lydian Courtesan; building it up to a great
height, so that when he was travelling in the country, inside of Mount
Tmolus, wherever he was, he could always see the tomb; and it was a
conspicuous object to all the inhabitants of Lydia." And Demosthenes
the orator, in his Speech against Neæra (if it is a genuine one, which
Apollodorus says it is), says&mdash;"Now we have courtesans for the sake
of pleasure, but concubines for the sake of daily cohabitation, and
wives for the purpose of having children legitimately, and of having a
faithful guardian of all our household affairs."</p>

<p>32. I will now mention to you, O Cynulcus, an Ionian story (spinning it
out, as Æschylus says,) about courtesans, beginning with the beautiful
Corinth, since you have reproached me with having been a schoolmaster
in that city.</p>

<p>It is an ancient custom at Corinth (as Chamæleon of Heraclea
relates, in his treatise on Pindar), whenever the city addresses any
supplication to Venus, about any important matter, to employ as many
courtesans as possible to join in the supplication; and they, too, pray
to the goddess, and afterwards they are present at the sacrifices.
And when the king of Persia was leading his army against Greece (as
Theopompus also relates, and so does Timæus, in his seventh book),
the Corinthian courtesans offered prayers for the safety of Greece,
going to the temple of Venus. On which account, after the Corinthians
had consecrated a picture to the goddess (which remains even to this
day), and as in this picture they had painted the portraits of the
courtesans who made this supplication at the time, and who were present
afterwards, Simonides composed this epigram:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse">These damsels, in behalf of Greece, and all</div>

    <div class="verse">Nor was the queen of beauty willing ever</div>

    <div class="verse">Beneath the arrows of the unwarlike Persians.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And even private individuals sometimes vow to Venus, that if they
succeed in the objects for which they are offering their vows, they
will bring her a stated number of courtesans.</p>

<p>33. As this custom, then, exists with reference to this goddess,
Xenophon the Corinthian, when going to Olympia, to the games, vowed
that he, if he were victorious, would bring her some courtesans. And
Pindar at first wrote a panegyric on him, which begins thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">

<p>But afterwards he composed a scolium<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
on him, which was sung at the sacrificial feasts; in the exordium of
which he turns at once to the courtesans who joined in the sacrifice
to Venus, in the presence of Xenophon, while he was sacrificing to the
goddess himself; on which account he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse">O queen of Cyprus' isle,</div>

<p>And it is plain here that the poet, while addressing the courtesans in
this way, was in some doubt as to the light in which it would appear to
the Corinthians; but, trusting to his own genius, he proceeds with the

<p>34. But at Lacedæmon (as Polemo Periegetes says, in his treatise on
the Offerings at Lacedæmon,) there is a statue of a very celebrated
courtesan, named Cottina, who, he tells us, consecrated a brazen
cow; and Polemo's words are these:&mdash;"And the statue of Cottina the
courtesan, on account of whose celebrity there is still a brothel which
is called by her name, near the hill on which the temple of Bacchus
stands, is a conspicuous object, well known to many of the citizens.
And there is also a votive offering of hers besides that to Minerva
Chalciœcos&mdash;a brazen cow, and also the before-mentioned image." And the
handsome Alcibiades, of whom one of the comic poets said&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>though he was beloved by the wife of Agis, used to go and held his
revels at the doors of the courtesans, leaving all the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 919]</span>

Lacedæmonian and Athenian women. He also fell in love with Medontis of Abydos, from
the mere report of her beauty; and sailing to the Hellespont with
Axiochus, who was a lover of his on account of his beauty, (as Lysias
the orator states, in his speech against him,) he allowed Axiochus to
share her with him. Moreover, Alcibiades used always to carry about two
other courtesans with him in all his expeditions, namely, Damasandra,
the mother of the younger Lais, and Theodote; by whom, after he was
dead, he was buried in Melissa, a village of Phrygia, after he had been
overwhelmed by the treachery of Pharnabazus. And we ourselves saw the
tomb of Alcibiades at Melissa, when we went from Synadæ to Metropolis;
and at that tomb there is sacrificed an ox every year, by the command
of that most excellent emperor Adrian, who also erected on the tomb a
statue of Alcibiades in Parian marble.</p>

<p>35. And we must not wonder at people having on some occasions fallen
in love with others from the mere report of their beauty, when Chares
of Mitylene, in the tenth book of his History of Alexander, says
that some people have even seen in dreams those whom they have never
beheld before, and fallen in love with them so. And he writes as
follows:&mdash;"Hystaspes had a younger brother whose name was Zariadres:
and they were both men of great personal beauty. And the story told
concerning them by the natives of the country is, that they were the
offspring of Venus and Adonis. Now Hystaspes was sovereign of Media,
and of the lower country adjoining it; and Zariadres was sovereign of
the country above the Caspian gates as far as the river Tanais. Now the
daughter of Omartes, the king of the Marathi, a tribe dwelling on the
other side of the Tanais, was named Odatis. And concerning her it is
written in the Histories, that she in her sleep beheld Zariadres, and
fell in love with him; and that the very same thing happened to him
with respect to her. And so for a long time they were in love with one
another, simply on account of the visions which they had seen in their
dreams. And Odatis was the most beautiful of all the women in Asia; and
Zariadres also was very handsome. Accordingly, when Zariadres sent to
Omartes and expressed a desire to marry the damsel, Omartes would not
agree to it, because he was destitute of male offspring; for he wished

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 920]</span>

to give her to one of his own people about his court. And not long
afterwards, Omartes having assembled all the chief men of his kingdom,
and all his friends and relations, held a marriage-feast, without
saying beforehand to whom he was going to give his daughter. And as the
wine went round, her father summoned Odatis to the banquet, and said,
in the hearing of all the guests,&mdash;'We, my daughter Odatis, are now
celebrating your marriage-feast; so now do you look around, and survey
all those who are present, and then take a golden goblet and fill it,
and give it to the man to whom you like to be married; for you shall be
called his wife.' And she, having looked round upon them all, went away
weeping, being anxious to see Zariadres, for she had sent him word that
her marriage-feast was about to be celebrated. But he, being encamped
on the Tanais, and leaving the army encamped there without being
perceived, crossed the river with his charioteer alone; and going by
night in his chariot, passed through the city, having gone about eight
hundred stadia without stopping. And when he got near the town in which
the marriage festival was being celebrated, and leaving, in some place
near, his chariot with the charioteer, he went forward by himself,
clad in a Scythian robe. And when he arrived at the palace, and seeing
Odatis standing in front of the side-board in tears, and filling the
goblet very slowly, he stood near her and said, 'O Odatis, here I am
come, as you requested me to,&mdash;I, Zariadres.' And she, perceiving a
stranger, and a handsome man, and that he resembled the man whom she
had beheld in her sleep, being exceedingly rejoiced, gave him the bowl.
And he, seizing on her, led her away to his chariot, and fled away,
having Odatis with him. And the servants and the handmaidens, knowing
their love, said not a word. And when her father ordered them to summon
her, they said that they did not know which way she was gone. And the
story of this love is often told by the barbarians who dwell in Asia,
and is exceedingly admired; and they have painted representations of
the story in their temples and palaces, and also in their private
houses. And a great many of the princes in those countries give their
daughters the name of Odatis."</p>

<p>36. Aristotle also, in his Constitution of the Massilians, mentions a
similar circumstance as having taken place, writing as follows:&mdash;"The

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 921]</span>

Phocæans in Ionia, having consulted the oracle, founded Marseilles.
And Euxenus the Phocæan was connected by ties of hospitality with
Nanus; this was the name of the king of that country. This Nanus was
celebrating the marriage-feast of his daughter, and invited Euxenus,
who happened to be in the neighbourhood, to the feast. And the marriage
was to be conducted in this manner:&mdash;After the supper was over the
damsel was to come in, and to give a goblet full of wine properly
mixed to whichever of the suitors who were present she chose; and to
whomsoever she gave it, he was to be the bridegroom. And the damsel
coming in, whether it was by chance or whether it was for any other
reason, gives the goblet to Euxenus. And the name of the maiden was
Petta. And when the cup had been given in this way, and her father
(thinking that she had been directed by the Deity in her giving of it)
had consented that Euxenus should have her, he took her for his wife,
and cohabited with her, changing her name to Aristoxena. And the family
which is descended from that damsel remains in Marseilles to this day,
and is known as the Protiadæ; for Protis was the name of the son of
Euxenus and Aristoxena."</p>

<p>37. And did not Themistocles, as Idomeneus relates, harness a chariot
full of courtesans and drive with them into the city when the market
was full? And the courtesans were Lamia and Scione and Satyra and
Nannium. And was not Themistocles himself the son of a courtesan,
whose name was Abrotonum? as Amphicrates relates in his treatise on

    <div class="verse">But for the weal of Greece</div>
    <div class="verse">She was the mother of the great Themistocles.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>But Neanthes of Cyzicus, in his third and fourth books of his History
of Grecian Affairs, says that he was the son of Euterpe.</p>

<p>And when Cyrus the younger was making his expedition against his
brother, did he not carry with him a courtesan of Phocæa, who was a
very clever and very beautiful woman? and Zenophanes says that her name
was originally Milto, but that it was afterwards changed to Aspasia.
And a Milesian concubine also accompanied him. And did not the great
Alexander keep Thais about him, who was an Athenian courtesan? And
Clitarchus speaks of her as having been the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 922]</span>

cause that the palace of Persepolis was burnt down. And this Thais,
after the death of Alexander, married Ptolemy, who became the first
king of Egypt, and she bore him sons, Leontiscus and Lagos, and a
daughter named Irene, who was married to Eunostus, the king of Soli,
a town of Cyprus. And the second king of Egypt, Ptolemy Philadelphus
by name, as Ptolemy Euergetes relates in the third book of his
Commentaries, had a great many mistresses,&mdash;namely, Didyma, who
was a native of the country, and very beautiful; and Bilisticha; and,
besides them, Agathoclea, and Stratonice, who had a great monument on
the sea-shore, near Eleusis; and Myrtium, and a great many more; as he
was a man excessively addicted to amatory pleasures. And Polybius, in
the fourteenth book of his History, says that there are a great many
statues of a woman named Clino, who was his cup-bearer, in Alexandria,
clothed in a tunic only, and holding a cornucopia in her hand. "And are
not," says he, "the finest houses called by the names of Myrtium, and
Mnesis, and Pothina? and yet Mnesis was only a female flute-player, and
so was Pothine, and Myrtium was one of the most notorious and common
prostitutes in the city."</p>

<p>Was there not also Agathoclea the courtesan, who had great power over
king Ptolemy Philopator? in fact, was it not she who was the ruin of
his whole kingdom? And Eumachus the Neapolitan, in the second book of
his History of Hannibal, says that Hieronymus, the tyrant of Syracuse,
fell in love with one of the common prostitutes who followed her trade
in a brothel, whose name was Pitho, and married her, and made her queen
of Syracuse.</p>

<p>38. And Timotheus, who was general of the Athenians, with a very
high reputation, was the son of a courtesan, a Thracian by birth, but,
except that she was a courtesan, of very excellent character; for when
women of this class do behave modestly, they are superior to those who
give themselves airs on account of their virtue. But Timotheus being on
one occasion reproached as being the son of a mother of that character,
said,&mdash;"But I am much obliged to her, because it is owing to
her that I am the son of Conon." And Carystius, in his Historic
Commentaries, says that Philetærus the king of Pergamus, and of all
that country which is now called the New Province, was the son of a
woman named

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 923]</span>

Boa, who was a flute-player and a courtesan, a Paphlagonian by birth.
And Aristophon the orator, who in the archonship of Euclides proposed
a law, that every one who was not born of a woman who was a citizen
should be accounted a bastard, was himself, convicted, by Calliades the
comic poet, of having children by a courtesan named Choregis, as the
same Carystius relates in the third book of his Commentaries.</p>

<p>Besides all these men, was not Demetrius Poliorcetes evidently in love
with Lamia the flute-player, by whom he had a daughter named Phila? And
Polemo, in his treatise on the colonnade called Pœcile at Sicyon, says
that Lamia was the daughter of Cleanor an Athenian, and that she built
the before-mentioned colonnade for the people of Sicyon. Demetrius was
also in love with Leæna, and she was also an Athenian courtesan; and
with a great many other women besides.</p>

<p>39. And Machon the comic poet, in his play entitled the Chriæ, speaks
thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">But as Leæna was by nature form'd</div>
    <div class="verse">To give her lovers most exceeding pleasure,</div>
    <div class="verse">And was besides much favour'd by Demetrius,</div>
    <div class="verse">They say that Lamia also gratified</div>
    <div class="verse">The king; and when he praised her grace and quickness,</div>
    <div class="verse">The damsel answer'd: And besides you can,</div>
    <div class="verse">If you do wish, subdue a lioness (λέαιναν).</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>But Lamia was always very witty and prompt in repartee, as also was
Gnathæna, whom we shall mention presently. And again Machon writes thus
about Lamia:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Demetrius the king was once displaying</div>
    <div class="verse">Amid his cups a great variety</div>
    <div class="verse">Of kinds of perfumes to his Lamia:</div>
    <div class="verse">Now Lamia was a female flute-player,</div>
    <div class="verse">With whom 'tis always said Demetrius</div>
    <div class="verse">Was very much in love. But when she scoff'd</div>
    <div class="verse">At all his perfumes, and, moreover, treated</div>
    <div class="verse">The monarch with exceeding insolence,</div>
    <div class="verse">He bade a slave bring some cheap unguent, and</div>
    <div class="verse">He rubbed himself with that, and smear'd his fingers,</div>
    <div class="verse">And said, "At least smell this, O Lamia,</div>
    <div class="verse">And see how much this scent does beat all others."</div>
    <div class="verse">She laughingly replied: "But know, O king,</div>
    <div class="verse">That smell does seem to me the worst of all."</div>
    <div class="verse">"But," said Demetrius, "I swear, by the gods,</div>
    <div class="verse">That 'tis produced from a right royal nut."</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>40. But Ptolemy the son of Agesarchus, in his History of Philopator,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 924]</span>

giving a list of the mistresses of the different kings, says&mdash;"Philip
the Macedonian promoted Philinna, the dancing-woman, by whom he had
Aridæus, who was king of Macedonia after Alexander. And Demetrius
Poliorcetes, besides the women who have already been mentioned, had a
mistress named Mania; and Antigonus had one named Demo, by whom he had
a son named Alcyoneus; and Seleucus the younger had two, whose names
were Mysta and Nysa." But Heraclides Lenebus, in the thirty-sixth book
of his History, says that Demo was the mistress of Demetrius; and that
his father Antigonus was also in love with her: and that he put to
death Oxythemis as having sinned a good deal with Demetrius; and he
also put to the torture and executed the maid-servants of Demo.</p>

<p>41. But concerning the name of Mania, which we have just mentioned, the
same Machon says this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Some one perhaps of those who hear this now,</div>
    <div class="verse">May fairly wonder how it came to pass</div>
    <div class="verse">That an Athenian woman had a name,</div>
    <div class="verse">Or e'en a nickname, such as Mania.</div>
    <div class="verse">For 'tis disgraceful for a woman thus</div>
    <div class="verse">To bear a Phrygian name; she being, too,</div>
    <div class="verse">A courtesan from the very heart of Greece.</div>
    <div class="verse">And how came she to sink the city of Athens,</div>
    <div class="verse">By which all other nations are much sway'd?</div>
    <div class="verse">The fact is that her name from early childhood</div>
    <div class="verse">Was this&mdash;Melitta. And as she grew up</div>
    <div class="verse">A trifle shorter than her playfellows,</div>
    <div class="verse">But with a sweet voice and engaging manners,</div>
    <div class="verse">And with such beauty and excellence of face</div>
    <div class="verse">As made a deep impression upon all men,</div>
    <div class="verse">She'd many lovers, foreigners and citizens.</div>
    <div class="verse">So that when any conversation</div>
    <div class="verse">Arose about this woman, each man said,</div>
    <div class="verse">The fair Melitta was his madness (μανία). Aye,</div>
    <div class="verse">And she herself contributed to this name;</div>
    <div class="verse">For when she jested she would oft repeat</div>
    <div class="verse">This word μανία; and when in sport she blamed</div>
    <div class="verse">Or praised any one, she would bring in,</div>
    <div class="verse">In either sentence, this word μανία.</div>
    <div class="verse">So some one of her lovers, dwelling on</div>
    <div class="verse">The word, appears to have nicknamed the girl</div>
    <div class="verse">Mania; and this extra name prevailed</div>
    <div class="verse">More than her real one. It seems, besides,</div>
    <div class="verse">That Mania was afflicted with the stone.</div>

<p>42. And that Mania was also excellent in witty repartee, Machon tells
us in these verses about her,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent2">There was a victor in the pancratium,</div>

    <div class="verse">The harlot with Antenor, was indignant:</div>
    <div class="verse">But she replied,&mdash;"My darling, never mind;</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">On one occasion, too, a foreigner,</div>

    <div class="verse">It happen'd that he had procured for supper</div>
    <div class="verse">Some of those table-jesters, common buffoons,</div>
    <div class="verse">Who always raise a laugh to please their feeders;</div>

    <div class="verse">Tell me, I pray you by the Gods, what animal</div>
    <div class="verse">You think runs fastest o'er the mountain-tops?"</div>
    <div class="verse">"Why, my love, a deserter," answer'd Mania.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Another time, when Mania came to see him,</div>

    <div class="verse">That once in battle he had lost his shield.</div>
    <div class="verse">But this brave soldier, looking somewhat fierce,</div>
    <div class="verse">Sent her away. And as she was departing,</div>
    <div class="verse">She said, "My love, don't be so much annoy'd;</div>
    <div class="verse">For 'twas not you, who, when you ran away,</div>

too; and it will not be unseasonable to enumerate some of them now.

    <div class="verse">And she, indignant, said, "You wretched girl,</div>
    <div class="verse">Take him and kiss him if he wishes it."</div>

    <div class="verse">One of those knavish wrestlers, men who sell</div>
    <div class="verse">Their battles, always taking care to lose them;</div>
    <div class="verse">And as he could not pass by easily,</div>

    <div class="verse">And all the donkeys and the mule to boot."</div>
    <div class="verse">But quick Gnathænium said, "My friend, I pray you,</div>

<div class="sidenote-left">COURTESANS.</div>

<p>46. Up to this point we have been recapitulating the things
mentioned by Macho. For our beautiful Athens has produced such a number
of courtesans (of whom I will tell you as many anecdotes as I can)
as no other populous city ever produced. At all events, Aristophanes
the Byzantian counted up a hundred and thirty-five, and Apollodorus
a still greater number; and Gorgias enumerated still more, saying
that, among a great many more, these eminent ones had been omitted by
Aristophanes&mdash;namely, one who was surnamed Paroinos, and Lampyris,
and Euphrosyne: and this last was the daughter of a fuller. And,
besides these, he has omitted Megisto, Agallis, Thaumarium, Theoclea
(and she was nicknamed the Crow), Lenætocystos, Astra, Gnathæna, and
her grand-daughter Gnathænium, and Sige, and Synoris (who was nicknamed
the Candle), and Euclea, and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 931]</span>

Grymæa, and Thryallis, and Chimæra, and Lampas. But Diphilus the comic
poet was violently in love with Gnathæna, (as has been already stated,
and as Lynceus the Samian relates in his Commentaries;) and so once,
when on the stage he had acted very badly, and was turned out (ἠρμένος)
of the theatre, and, for all that, came to Gnathæna as if nothing had
happened; and when he, after he had arrived, begged Gnathæna to wash
his feet, "Why do you want that?" said she; "were you not carried
(ἠρμένος) hither?" And Gnathæna was very ready with her repartees. And
there were other courtesans who had a great opinion of themselves,
paying attention to education, and spending a part of their time on
literature; so that they were very ready with their rejoinders and
replies.</p>

<p>Accordingly, when on one occasion Stilpo, at a banquet, was accusing
Glycera of seducing the young men of the city, (as Satyrus mentions in
his Lives,) Glycera took him up and said, "You and I are accused of
the same thing, O Stilpo; for they say that you corrupt all who come
to you, by teaching them profitless and amorous sophistries; and they
accuse me of the same thing: for if people waste their time, and are
treated ill, it makes no difference whether they are living with a
philosopher or with a harlot." For, according to Agathon,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">It does not follow, because a woman's body</div>
    <div class="verse">Is void of strength, that her mind, too, is weak.</div>
    <div class="verse"></div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>47. And Lynceus has recorded many repartees of Gnathæna. There was a
parasite who used to live upon an old woman, and kept himself in very
good condition; and Gnathæna, seeing him, said, "My young friend,
you appear to be in very good case." "What then do you think," said
he, "that I should be if I slept by myself?" "Why, I think you would
starve," said she. Once, when Pausanius, who was nicknamed Laccus,<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
was dancing, he fell into a cask. "The cellar," says Gnathæna, "has
fallen into the cask." On one occasion, some one put a very little wine
into a wine-cooler, and said that it was sixteen years old. "It is
very little of its age," said she, "to be as old as that." Once at a
drinking-party, some young men were fighting about her, and beating one

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 932]</span>

another, and she said to the one who was worsted, "Be of
good cheer, my boy; for it is not a contest to be decided by crowns,
but by guineas." There was a man who once gave her daughter a mina,
and never brought her anything more, though he came to see her very
often. "Do you think, my boy," said she, "that now you have once paid
your mina, you are to come here for ever, as if you were going to
Hippomachus the trainer?" On one occasion, when Phryne said to her,
with some bitterness, "What would become of you if you had the stone?"
"I would give it to you," said she, "to sharpen your wit upon." For
it was said that Gnathæna was liable to the stone, while the other
certainly wanted it as Gnathæna hinted. On one occasion, some men were
drinking in her house, and were eating some lentils dressed with onions
(βολβοφάκη); as the maidservant was clearing the table, and
putting some of the lentils in her bosom (κόλπον), Gnathæna
said, "She is thinking of making some κολποφάκη."</p>

<p>Once, when Andronicus the tragedian had been acting his part in the
representation of the Epigoni with great applause, and was coming to
a drinking-party at her house, and sent a boy forward to bid her make
preparation to receive him, she said&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">"O cursed boy, what word is this you've spoken?"</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And once, when a chattering fellow was relating that he was just
come from the Hellespont, "Why, then," said she, "did you not go to
the first city in that country?" and when he asked what city, "To
Sigeum,"<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
said she. Once, when a man came to see her, and saw some eggs on a
dish, and said, "Are these raw, Gnathæna, or boiled?" "They are made
of brass, my boy," said she. On one occasion, when Chærephon came to
sup with her without an invitation, Gnathæna pledged him in a cup of
wine. "Take it," said she, "you proud fellow." And he said, "I proud?"
"Who can be more so," said she, "when you come without even being
invited?" And Nico, who was nicknamed the Goat (as Lynceus tells us),
once when she met a parasite, who was very thin in consequence of a
long sickness, said to him, "How lean you are." "No wonder," says he;
"for what do you think is all that I have had to eat these three days?"
"Why, a leather bottle," says she, "or perhaps your shoes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 933]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">COURTESANS.</div>

<p>48. There was a courtesan named Metanira; and when Democles the
parasite, who was nicknamed Lagynion, fell down in a lot of whitewash,
she said, "Yes, for you have devoted yourself to a place where
there are pebbles." And when he sprung upon a couch which was near
him, "Take care," said she, "lest you get upset." These sayings are
recorded by Hegesander. And Aristodemus, in the second book of his
Laughable Records, says that Gnathæna was hired by two men, a soldier
and a branded slave; and so when the soldier, in his rude manner,
called her a cistern, "How can I be so?" said she; "is it because two
rivers, Lycus and Eleutherus, fall into me?" On one occasion, when
some poor lovers of the daughter of Gnathæna came to feast at her
house, and threatened to throw it down, saying that they had brought
spades and mattocks on purpose; "But," said Gnathæna, "if you had
those implements, you should have pawned them, and brought some money
with you." And Gnathæna was always very neat and witty in all she
said; and she even compiled a code of laws for banquets, according
to which lovers were to be admitted to her and to her daughters, in
imitation of the philosophers, who had drawn up similar documents. And
Callimachus has recorded this code of hers in the third Catalogue of
Laws which he has given; and he has quoted the first words of it as
follows:&mdash;"This law has been compiled, being fair and equitable;
and it is written in three hundred and twenty-three verses."</p>

<p>49. But a slave who had been flogged hired Callistium, who was
nicknamed Poor Helen; and as it was summer, and he was lying down
naked, she, seeing the marks of the whip, said, "Where did you get
this, you unhappy man?" and he said, "Some broth was spilt over me when
I was a boy." And she said, "It must have been made of neats'-leather."
And once, when Menander the poet had failed with one of his plays,
and came to her house, Glycera brought him some milk, and recommended
him to drink it. But he said he would rather not, for there was some
γραῦς<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
on it. But she replied, "Blow it away, and take what there is
beneath."</p>

<p>Thais said once to a boastful lover of hers, who had borrowed some
goblets from a great many people, and said that he meant to break them
up, and make others of them, "You will destroy what belongs to each
private person." Leontium was once sitting at table with a lover of
hers, when Glycera

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 934]</span>

came in to supper; and as the man began to pay more attention to
Glycera, Leontium was much annoyed: and presently, when her friend
turned round, and asked her what she was vexed at, she said, "Ἡ ὑστέρα<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
pains me."</p>

<p>A lover of hers once sent his seal to Lais the Corinthian, and desired
her to come to him; but she said, "I cannot come; it is only clay."
Thais was one day going to a lover of hers, who smelt like a goat; and
when some one asked her whither she was going, she said&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">To dwell with Ægeus,<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> great Pandion's son.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Phryne, too, was once supping with a man of the same description, and,
lifting up the hide of a pig, she said, "Take it, and eat<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> it."
And once, when one of her friends sent her some wine, which was very
good, but the quantity was small; and when he told her that it was ten
years old; "It is very little of its age," said she. And once, when
the question was asked at a certain banquet, why it is that crowns are
hung up about banqueting-rooms, she said, "Because they delight the
mind."<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
And once, when a slave, who had been flogged, was giving
himself airs as a young man towards her, and saying that he had been
often entangled, she pretended to look vexed; and when he asked her
the reason, "I am jealous of you," said she, "because you have been so
often smitten."<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
Once a very covetous lover of hers was coaxing her,
and saying to her, "You are the Venus of Praxiteles;" "And you," said
she, "are the Cupid of Phidias."<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">COURTESANS.</div>

<p>50. And as I am aware that some of those men who have been involved
in the administration of affairs of state have mentioned courtesans,
either accusing or excusing them, I will enumerate some instances
of those who have done so. For Demosthenes, in his speech against
Androtion, mentions Sinope and Phanostrate; and respecting Sinope,
Herodicus the pupil of Crates says, in the sixth book of his treatise
on People mentioned in the Comic Poets, that she was called Abydus,
because she was an old woman. And Antiphanes

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 935]</span>

mentions her in his Arcadian, and in his Gardener,
and in his Sempstress, and in his Female Fisher, and in his Neottis.
And Alexis mentions her in his Cleobuline, and Callicrates speaks
of her in his Moschion; and concerning Phanostrate, Apollodorus,
in his treatise on the Courtesans at Athens, says that she was
called Phtheiropyle, because she used to stand at the door (πύλη) and hunt for lice (φθεῖρες).</p>

<p>And in his oration against Aristagoras, Hyperides says&mdash;"And again you
have named, in the same manner, the animals called aphyæ." Now, aphyæ,
besides meaning anchovies, was also a nickname for some courtesans;
concerning whom the before-mentioned Apollodorus says&mdash;"Stagonium and
Amphis were two sisters, and they were called Aphyæ, because they were
white, and thin, and had large eyes." And Antiphanes, in his book on
Courtesans, says that Nicostratis was called Aphya for the same reason.
And the same Hyperides, in his speech against Mantitheus, who was being
prosecuted for an assault, speaks in the following manner respecting
Glycera&mdash;"Bringing with him Glycera the daughter of Thalassis in a
pair-horse chariot." But it is uncertain whether this is the same
Glycera who was the mistress of Harpalus; concerning whom Theopompus
speaks in his treatise on the Chian Epistle, saying that after the
death of Pythionica, Harpalus sent for Glycera to come to him from
Athens; and when she came, she lived in the palace which is at Tarsus,
and was honoured with royal honours by the populace, and was called
queen; and an edict was issued, forbidding any one to present Harpalus
with a crown, without at the same time presenting Glycera with another.
And at Rhossus, he went so far as to erect a brazen statue of her by
the side of his own statue. And Clitarchus has given the same account
in his History of Alexander. But the author of Agen, a satyric drama,
(whoever he was, whether it was Python of Catana, or king Alexander
himself,) says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">And now they say that Harpalus has sent them</div>
    <div class="verse">Unnumber'd sacks of corn, no fewer than</div>
    <div class="verse">Those sent by Agen, and is made a citizen:</div>
    <div class="verse">But this was Glycera's corn, and it may be</div>
    <div class="verse">Ruin to them, and not a harlot's earnest.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>51. And Lysias, in his oration against Lais, if, indeed, the speech is
a genuine one, mentions these circumstances&mdash;"Philyra abandoned the
trade of a harlot when she was still quite young; and so did Scione,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 936]</span>

and Hippaphesis, and Theoclea, and Psamathe, and Lagisca, and Anthea."
But perhaps, instead of Anthea, we ought to read Antea. For I do not
find any mention made by any one of a harlot named Anthea. But there is
a whole play named after Antea, by either Eunicus or Philyllius. And
the author of the oration against Neæra, whoever he was, also mentions
her. But in the oration against Philonides, who was being prosecuted
for an assault, Lysias, if at least it is a genuine speech of his,
mentions also a courtesan called Nais. And in his speech against
Medon, for perjury, he mentions one by the name of Anticyra; but this
was only a nickname given to a woman, whose real name was Hoia, as
Antiphanes informs us in his treatise on Courtesans, where he says that
she was called Anticyra,<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a
href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> because she was in the
habit of drinking with men who were crazy and mad; or else because
she was at one time the mistress of Nicostratus the physician, and
he, when he died, left her a great quantity of hellebore, and nothing
else. Lycurgus, also, in his oration against Leocrates, mentions
a courtesan named Irenis, as being the mistress of Leocrates. And
Hyperides mentions Nico in his oration against Patrocles. And we have
already mentioned that she used to be nicknamed the Goat, because she
had ruined Thallus the innkeeper. And that the goats are very fond of
the young shoots of the olive (θάλλοι), on which account the animal is
never allowed to approach the Acropolis, and is also never sacrificed
to Minerva, is a fact which we shall dilate upon hereafter. But
Sophocles, in his play called The Shepherds, mentions that this animal
does browse upon the young shoots, speaking as follows&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">COURTESANS.</div>

<p>Alexis also mentions Nannium, in his Tarentines, thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">

   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">But Nannium is mad for love of Bacchus,&mdash;</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 937]</span></p>

<p>jesting upon her as addicted to intoxication. And Menander, in his
false Hercules, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Did he not try to wheedle Nannium?</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And Antiphanes, in his treatise on Courtesans, says&mdash;"Nannium was
nicknamed the Proscenium, because she had a beautiful face, and used
to wear very costly garments embroidered with gold, but when she
was undressed she was a very bad figure. And Corone was Nannium's
daughter, and she was nicknamed Tethe, from her exceedingly debauched
habits." Hyperides, in his oration against Patrocles, also speaks of
a female flute-player named Nemeas. And we may wonder how it was that
the Athenians permitted a courtesan to have such a name, which was
that of a most honourable and solemn festival. For not only those who
prostituted themselves, but all other slaves also were forbidden to
take such names as that, as Polemo tells us, in his treatise on the
Acropolis.</p>

<p>52. The same Hyperides also mentions my Ocimum, as you call her, O
Cynulcus, in his second oration against Aristagoras, speaking thus&mdash;"As
Lais, who appears to have been superior in beauty to any woman who had
ever been seen, and Ocimum, and Metanira." And Nicostratus, a poet of
the middle comedy, mentions her also in his Pandrosus, where he says&mdash;</p>

<p>53. Now when Myrtilus had uttered all this with extreme volubility, he
added:&mdash;May no such disaster befal you, O philosophers, who even before
the rise of the sect called Voluptuaries, yourselves broke down the
wall of pleasure, as Eratosthenes somewhere or other expresses it. And
indeed I have now quoted enough of the smart sayings of the courtesans,
and I will pass on to another topic. And first of all, I will speak
of that most devoted lover of truth, Epicurus, who, never having been
initiated into the encyclic series of learning, used to say that
those were well off who applied themselves to philosophy in the same
way in which he did himself; and these were his words&mdash;"I praise and
congratulate you, my young man, because you have come over to the study
of philosophy unimbued with any system." On which account Timon styles
him&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse">The most unletter'd schoolmaster alive.</div>

</div>

<p>Now, had not this very Epicurus Leontium for his mistress, her, I mean,
who was so celebrated as a courtesan? But she did not cease to live as
a prostitute when she began to learn philosophy, but still prostituted
herself to the whole sect of Epicureans in the gardens, and to Epicurus
himself, in the most open manner; so that this great philosopher was
exceedingly fond of her, though he mentions this fact in his epistles
to Hermarchus.</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">COURTESANS.</div>

<p>54. But as for Lais of Hyccara&mdash;(and Hyccara is a city in
Sicily, from which place she came to Corinth, having been made a
prisoner of war, as Polemo relates in the sixth book of his History,
addressed to Timæus: and Aristippus was one of her lovers, and so was
Demosthenes the orator, and Diogenes the Cynic: and it was also said
that the Venus, which is at Corinth, and is called Melænis, appeared
to her in a dream, intimating to her by such an appearance that she
would be courted by many lovers of great wealth;)&mdash;Lais, I say,
is mentioned by Hyperides, in the second of his speeches against
Aristagoras. And Apelles the painter, having seen

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 939]</span>

Lais while she was still a maiden, drawing water at the fountain
Pirene, and marvelling at her beauty, took her with him on one occasion
to a banquet of his friends. And when his companions laughed at him
because he had brought a maiden with him to the party, instead of a
courtesan, he said&mdash;"Do not wonder, for I will show you that she
is quite beautiful enough for future enjoyment within three years."
And a prediction of this sort was made by Socrates also, respecting
Theodote the Athenian, as Xenophon tells us in his Memorabilia, for he
used to say&mdash;"That she was very beautiful, and had a bosom finely
shaped beyond all description. And let us," said he, "go and see the
woman; for people cannot judge of beauty by hearsay." But Lais was so
beautiful, that painters used to come to her to copy her bosom and her
breasts. And Lais was a rival of Phryne, and had an immense number of
lovers, never caring whether they were rich or poor, and never treating
them with any insolence.</p>

<p>55. And Aristippus every year used to spend whole days with her in
Ægina, at the festival of Neptune. And once, being reproached by his
servant, who said to him&mdash;"You give her such large sums of money, but
she admits Diogenes the Cynic for nothing:" he answered, "I give Lais a
great deal, that I myself may enjoy her, and not that no one else may."
And when Diogenes said, "Since you, O Aristippus, cohabit with a common
prostitute, either, therefore, become a Cynic yourself, as I am, or
else abandon her;" Aristippus answered him&mdash;"Does it appear to you, O
Diogenes, an absurd thing to live in a house where other men have lived
before you?" "Not at all," said he. "Well, then, does it appear to you
absurd to sail in a ship in which other men have sailed before you?"
"By no means," said he. "Well, then," replied Aristippus, "it is not a
bit more absurd to be in love with a woman with whom many men have been
in love already."</p>

<p>And Nymphodorus the Syracusan, in his treatise on the People who
have been admired and eminent in Sicily, says that Lais was a native
of Hyccara, which he describes as a strong fortress in Sicily. But
Strattis, in his play entitled The Macedonians or Pausanias, says that
she was a Corinthian, in the following lines&mdash;</p>

 </div>

<p>And Timæus, in the thirteenth book of his History, says she came from
Hyccara, (using the word in the plural number;) as Polemo has stated,
where he says that she was murdered by some women in Thessaly, because
she was beloved by a Thessalian of the name of Pausanias; and that she
was beaten to death, out of envy and jealousy, by wooden footstools in
the temple of Venus; and that from this circumstance that temple is
called the temple of the impious Venus; and that her tomb is shown on
the banks of the Peneus, having on it an emblem of a stone water-ewer,
and this inscription&mdash;</p>

<p>56. And did not Aristotle the Stagirite have a son named Nicomachus
by a courtesan named Herpyllis? and did he not live with her till his
death? as Hermippus informs us in the first book of his History of
Aristotle, saying that great care was taken of her in the philosopher's
will. And did not our admirable Plato love Archaianassa, a courtesan of
Colophon? so that he even composed this song in her honour:&mdash;</p>

<p>And did not Pericles the Olympian (as Clearchus tells us in the
first book of his treatise on Amatory Matters) throw all Greece into
confusion on account of Aspasia, not the younger one, but that one
who associated with the wise Socrates; and that, too, though he was a
man who had acquired such a vast reputation for wisdom and political
sagacity? But, indeed, Pericles was always a man much addicted to amorous

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 941]</span>

indulgences; and he cohabited even with his own son's wife, as
Stesimbrotus the Thasian informs us; and Stesimbrotus was a
contemporary of his, and had seen him, as he tells us in his book
entitled a Treatise on Themistocles, and Thucydides, and Pericles.
And Antisthenes, the pupil of Socrates, tells us that Pericles, being
in love with Aspasia, used to kiss her twice every day, once when he
entered her house, and once when he left it. And when she was impeached
for impiety, he himself spoke in her behalf, and shed more tears for
her sake than he did when his own property and his own life were
imperilled. Moreover, when Cimon had had an incestuous intrigue with
Elpinice, his sister, who was afterwards given in marriage to Callias,
and when he was banished, Pericles contrived his recall, exacting the
favours of Elpinice as his recompense.</p>

<p>And Pythænetus, in the third book of his History of Ægina, says that
Periander fell violently in love with Melissa, the daughter of Procles
of Epidaurus, when he had seen her clothed in the Peloponnesian fashion
(for she had on no cloak, but a single tunic only, and was acting
as cup-bearer to the young men,) and he married her. And Tigris of
Leucadia was the mistress of Pyrrhus king of Epirus, who was the third
in descent from the Pyrrhus who invaded Italy; but Olympias, the young
man's mother, took her off by poison.</p>

<p>57. And Ulpian, as if he had got some unexpected gain, while Myrtilus
was still speaking, said:&mdash;Do we say ὁ τίγρις in the
masculine gender? for I know that Philemon says this in his play called
Neæra:&mdash;</p>

<p>And Myrtilus said to him:&mdash;Since you interrupted us when we were
making out a catalogue of women, not like the lists of Sosicrates the
Phanagorite, or like the catalogue of women of Nilænetus the Samian or
Abderitan (whichever was really his native country), I, digressing a
little, will turn to your question, my old Phœnix. Learn, then, that

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 942]</span>

Alexis, in his Pyraunus, has said τὸν τίγριν, using the word in the
masculine gender; and these are his words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Come, open quick the door; I have been here,</div>
    <div class="verse">Though all unseen, walking some time,&mdash;a statue,</div>
    <div class="verse">A millstone, and a seahorse, and a wall,</div>
    <div class="verse">The tiger (ὁ τίγρις) of Seleucus.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And I might quote other evidences of the fact, but I postpone them for
the present, while I finish my catalogue, as far as it comprehends the
beautiful women.</p>

<p>58. For Clearchus speaks thus concerning Epaminondas: "Epaminondas the
Theban behaved with more dignity than these men did; but still there
was a want of dignity in the way in which he was induced to waver in
his sentiments in his association with women, as any one will admit
who considers his conduct with the wife of Lacon." But Hyperides the
orator, having driven his son Glaucippus out of his house, received
into it that most extravagant courtesan Myrrhina, and kept her in the
city; and he also kept Aristagora in the Piræus, and Phila at Eleusis,
whom he bought for a very large sum, and then emancipated; and after
that he made her his housekeeper, as Idomeneus relates. But, in his
oration in defence of Phryne, Hyperides confesses that he is in love
with the woman; and yet, before he had got cured of that love, he
introduced the above-mentioned Myrrhina into his house.</p>

<p>59. Now Phryne was a native of Thespiæ; and being prosecuted by
Euthias on a capital charge, she was acquitted: on which account
Euthias was so indignant that he never instituted any prosecution
afterwards, as Hermippus tells us. But Hyperides, when pleading
Phryne's cause, as he did not succeed at all, but it was plain that the
judges were about to condemn her, brought her forth into the middle of
the court, and, tearing open her tunic and displaying her naked bosom,
employed all the end of his speech, with the highest oratorical art, to
excite the pity of her judges by the sight of her beauty, and inspired
the judges with a superstitious fear, so that they were so moved by
pity as not to be able to stand the idea of condemning to death "a
prophetess and priestess of Venus." And when she was acquitted, a
decree was drawn up in the following form: "That hereafter no orator
should endeavour to excite pity on behalf of anyone, and that no man
or woman, when impeached, shall have his or her case decided on while
present."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 943]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">COURTESANS.</div>

<p>But Phryne was a really beautiful woman, even in those parts of her
person which were not generally seen: on which account it was not easy
to see her naked; for she used to wear a tunic which covered her whole
person, and she never used the public baths. But on the solemn assembly
of the Eleusinian festival, and on the feast of the Posidonia, then
she laid aside her garments in the sight of all the assembled Greeks,
and having undone her hair, she went to bathe in the sea; and it was
from her that Apelles took his picture of the Venus Anadyomene; and
Praxiteles the statuary, who was a lover of hers, modelled the Cnidian
Venus from her body; and on the pedestal of his statue of Cupid, which
is placed below the stage in the theatre, he wrote the following
inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Praxiteles has devoted earnest care</div>
    <div class="verse">To representing all the love he felt,</div>
    <div class="verse">Drawing his model from his inmost heart:</div>
    <div class="verse">I gave myself to Phryne for her wages,</div>
    <div class="verse">And now I no more charms employ, nor arrows,</div>
    <div class="verse">Save those of earnest glances at my love.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And he gave Phryne the choice of his statues, whether she chose to take
the Cupid, or the Satyrus which is in the street called the Tripods;
and she, having chosen the Cupid, consecrated it in the temple at
Thespiæ. And the people of her neighbourhood, having had a statue
made of Phryne herself, of solid gold, consecrated it in the temple
of Delphi, having had it placed on a pillar of Pentelican marble; and
the statue was made by Praxiteles. And when Crates the Cynic saw it,
he called it "a votive offering of the profligacy of Greece." And this
statue stood in the middle between that of Archidamus, king of the
Lacedæmonians, and that of Philip the son of Amyntas; and it bore this
inscription&mdash;"Phryne of Thespiæ, the daughter of Epicles," as we are
told by Alcetas, in the second book of his treatise on the Offerings at
Delphi.</p>

<p>60. But Apollodorus, in his book on Courtesans, says that there were
two women named Phryne, one of whom was nicknamed Clausigelos,<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
and the other Saperdium. But Herodicus,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 944]</span>

in the sixth book of his Essay on People mentioned by the Comic Poets,
says that the one who is mentioned by the orators was called Sestos,
because she sifted (ἀποσήθω) and stripped bare all her
lovers; and that the other was the native of Thespiæ. But Phryne was
exceedingly rich, and she offered to build a wall round Thebes, if the
Thebans would inscribe on the wall, "Alexander destroyed this wall,
but Phryne the courtesan restored it;" as Callistratus states in his
treatise on Courtesans. And Timocles the comic poet, in his Neæra,
has mentioned her riches (the passage has been already cited); and so
has Amphis, in his Curis. And Gryllion was a parasite of Phryne's,
though he was one of the judges of the Areopagus; as also Satyrus,
the Olynthian actor, was a parasite of Pamphila. But Aristogiton, in
his book against Phryne, says that her proper name was Mnesarete; and
I am aware that Diodorus Periegetes says that the oration against
her which is ascribed to Euthias, is really the work of Anaximenes.
But Posidippus the comic poet, in his Ephesian Women, speaks in the
following manner concerning her:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Before our time, the Thespian Phryne was</div>
    <div class="verse">Far the most famous of all courtesans;</div>
    <div class="verse">And even though you're later than her age,</div>
    <div class="verse">Still you have heard of the trial which she stood.</div>
    <div class="verse">She was accused on a capital charge</div>
    <div class="verse">Before the Heliæa, being said</div>
    <div class="verse">To have corrupted all the citizens;</div>
    <div class="verse">But she besought the judges separately</div>
    <div class="verse">With tears, and so just saved herself from judgment.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>61. And I would have you all to know that Democles, the orator, became
the father of Demeas, by a female flute-player who was a courtesan; and
once when he, Demeas, was giving himself airs in the tribune, Hyperides
stopped his mouth, saying, "Will not you be silent, young man? why,
you make more puffing than your mother did." And also Bion of the
Borysthenes, the philosopher, was the son of a Lacedæmonian courtesan
named Olympia; as Nicias the Nicæan informs us in his treatise called
the Successions of the Philosophers. And Sophocles the tragedian,
when he was an old man, was a lover of Theoris the courtesan; and
accordingly, supplicating the favour and assistance of Venus, he says&mdash;</p>

<p>And these verses are some of those which are at times attributed to

plain choruses:&mdash;</p>

<p>And towards the end of his life, as Hegesander says, he was a lover
of the courtesan Archippa, and he left her the heiress of all his
property; but as Archippa cohabited with Sophocles, though he was very
old, Smicrines, her former lover, being asked by some one what Archippa
was doing, said very wittily, "Why, like the owls, she is sitting on
the tombs."</p>

<p>62. But Isocrates also, the most modest of all the orators, had a
mistress named Metanira, who was very beautiful, as Lysias relates in
his Letters. But Demosthenes, in his oration against Neæra, says that
Metanira was the mistress of Lysias. And Lysias also was desperately
in love with Lagis the courtesan, whose panegyric Cephalus the orator
wrote, just as Alcidamas the Elæan, the pupil of Gorgias, himself
wrote a panegyric on the courtesan Nais. And, in his oration against
Philonides, who was under prosecution for an assault, (if, at least,
the oration be a genuine one,) Lysias says that Nais was the mistress
of Philonides, writing as follows:&mdash;"There is then a woman who is a
courtesan, Nais by name, whose keeper is Archias; but your friend
Philonides states himself to be in love with her." Aristophanes also
mentions her in his Gerytades, and perhaps also in his Plutus, where he
says&mdash;</p>

   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Is it not owing to you the greedy Lais</div>
    <div class="verse">Does love Philonides?</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>For perhaps here we ought to read Nais, and not Lais. But Hermippus, in
his Essay on Isocrates, says that Isocrates, when he was advancing in
years, took the courtesan Lagisca to his house, and had a daughter by
her. And Strattis speaks of her in these lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">And while she still was in her bed, I saw</div>

   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 946]</span></p>

<p>And Lysias, in his speech against Lais, (if, at least, the oration be
a genuine one,) mentions her, giving a list of other courtesans also,
in the following words:&mdash;"Philyra indeed abandoned the trade of a
courtesan while she was still young; and Scione, and Hippaphesis, and
Theoclea, and Psamathe, and Lagisca, and Anthea, and Aristoclea, all
abandoned it also at an early age."</p>

<p>63. But it is reported that Demosthenes the orator had children by
a courtesan; at all events he himself, in his speech about gold,
introduced his children before the court, in order to obtain pity by
their means, without their mother; although it was customary to bring
forward the wives of those who were on their trial; however, he did
this for shame's sake, hoping to avoid calumny. But this orator was
exceedingly addicted to amorous indulgences, as Idomeneus tells us.
Accordingly, being in love with a youth named Aristarchus, he once,
when he was intoxicated, insulted Nicodemus on his account, and struck
out his eyes. He is related also to have been very extravagant in his
table, and his followers, and in women. Therefore, his secretary once
said, "But what can any one say of Demosthenes? For everything that he
has thought of for a whole year, is all thrown into confusion by one
woman in one night." Accordingly, he is said to have received into his
house a youth named Cnosion, although he had a wife; and she, being
indignant at this, went herself and slept with Cnosion.</p>

had a mistress named Myrrhina, a Samian courtesan; and in every respect
but the crown, he made her his partner in the kingdom, as Nicolaus of
Damascus tells us. And Ptolemy the son of Ptolemy Philadelphus the
king, who was governor of the garrison in Ephesus, had a mistress named
Irene. And she, when plots were laid against Ptolemy by the Thracians
at Ephesus, and when he fled to the temple of Diana, fled with him: and
when the conspirators had murdered him, Irene seizing hold of the bars
of the doors of the temple, sprinkled the altar with his blood till
they slew her also. And Sophron the governor of Ephesus had a mistress,
Danae, the daughter of Leontium the Epicurean, who was also a courtesan
herself. And by her means he was saved when
a plot was laid against him by Laodice, and Laodice was thrown

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 947]</span>

down a precipice, as Phylarchus relates in his twelfth book in these
words: "Danae was a chosen companion of Laodice, and was trusted by
her with all her secrets; and, being the daughter of that Leontium who
had studied with Epicurus the natural philosopher, and having been
herself formerly the mistress of Sophron, she, perceiving that Laodice
was laying a plot to murder Sophron, revealed the plot to Sophron by
a sign. And he, understanding the sign, and pretending to agree to
what she was saying to him, asked two days to deliberate on what he
should do. And, when she had agreed to that, he fled away by night to
Ephesus. But Laodice, when she learnt what had been done by Danae,
threw her down a precipice, discarding all recollection of their former
friendship. And they say that Danae, when she perceived the danger
which was impending over her, was interrogated by Laodice, and refused
to give her any answer; but, when she was dragged to the precipice,
then she said, that "many people justly despise the Deity, and they may
justify themselves by my case, who having saved a man who was to me as
my husband, am requited in this manner by the Deity. But Laodice, who
murdered her husband, is thought worthy of such honour."</p>

<p>The same Phylarchus also speaks of Mysta, in his fourteenth book, in
these terms: "Mysta was the mistress of Seleucus the king, and when
Seleucus was defeated by the Galatæ, and was with difficulty able to
save himself by flight, she put off the robes of a queen which she
had been accustomed to wear, and assumed the garment of an ordinary
servant; and being taken prisoner, was carried away with the rest of
the captives. And being sold in the same manner as her handmaidens, she
came to Rhodes; and there, when she had revealed who she was, she was
sent back with great honour to Seleucus by the Rhodians."</p>

<p>65. But Demetrius Phalereus being in love with Lampito, a courtesan of
Samos, was pleased when he himself was addressed as Lampito, as Diyllus
tells us; and he also had himself called Charitoblepharos.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> And
Nicarete the courtesan was the mistress of Stephanus the orator; and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 948]</span>

Metanira was the mistress of Lysias the sophist; and these
women were the slaves of Casius the Elean, with many other such, as
Antea, Stratola, Aristoclea, Phila, Isthmias, and Neæra. But Neæra was
the mistress of Stratoclides, and also of Xenoclides the poet, and of
Hipparchus the actor, and of Phrynion the Pæanian, who was the son of
Demon and the nephew of Demochares. And Phrynichus and Stephanus the
orator used to have Neæra in turn, each a day, since their friends had
so arbitrated the matter for them; and the daughter of Neæra, whose
name was Strymbela, and who was afterwards called Phano, Stephanus
gave (as if she had been his own daughter) in marriage to Phrastor of
Ægialea; as Demosthenes tells us in his oration against Neæra. And he
also speaks in the following manner about Sinope the courtesan: "And
you punished Archias the hierophant, when he was convicted before the
regular tribunals of behaving with impiety, and offering sacrifices
which were contrary to the laws of the nation. And he was accused also
of other things, and among them of having sacrificed a victim on the
festival of Ceres, which was offered by Sinope the courtesan, on the
altar which is in the court of the temple at Eleusis, though it is
against the law to sacrifice any victims on that day; and though, too,
it was no part of his duty to sacrifice at all, but it belonged to the
priestess to do so."</p>

<p>66. Plangon the Milesian was also a celebrated courtesan; and she,
as she was most wonderfully beautiful, was beloved by a young man
of Colophon, who had a mistress already whose name was Bacchis.
Accordingly, when this young man began to address his solicitations
to Plangon, she, having heard of the beauty of Bacchis, and wishing
to make the young man abandon his love for her, when she was unable
to effect that, she required as the price of her favours the necklace
of Bacchis, which was very celebrated. And he, as he was exceedingly
in love, entreated Bacchis not to see him totally overwhelmed with
despair; and Bacchis, seeing the excited state of the young man, gave
him the necklace. And Plangon, when she saw the freedom from jealousy
which was exhibited by Bacchis, sent her back the necklace, but kept
the young man: and ever after Plangon and Bacchis were friends, loving
the young man in common; and the Ionians being amazed at this, as
Menetor tells us in his treatise concerning Offerings, gave Plangon the
name of Pasiphila.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
And Archilochus mentions her in the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<p>That Menander the poet was a lover of Glycera, is notorious to
everybody; but still he was not well pleased with her. For when
Philemon was in love with a courtesan, and in one of his plays called
her "Excellent," Menander, in one of his plays, said, in contradiction
to this, that there was no courtesan who was good.</p>

<p>67. And Harpalus the Macedonian, who robbed Alexander of vast sums
of money and then fled to Athens, being in love with Pythionica, spent
an immense deal of money on her; and she was a courtesan. And when she
died he erected a monument to her which cost him many talents. And
as he was carrying her out to burial, as Posidonius tells us in the
twenty-second book of his History, he had the body accompanied with
a band of the most eminent artists of all kinds, and with all sorts
of musical instruments and songs. And Dicæarchus, in his Essay on the
Descent to the Cave of Trophonius, says,&mdash;"And that same sort of
thing may happen to any one who goes to the city of the Athenians, and
who proceeds by the road leading from Eleusis, which is called the
Sacred Road; for, if he stops at that point from which he first gets a
sight of Athens, and of the temple, and of the citadel, he will see a
tomb built by the wayside, of such a size that there is none other near
which can be compared with it for magnitude. And at first, as would be
natural, he would pronounce it to be the tomb, beyond all question, of
Miltiades, or Cimon, or Pericles, or of some other of the great men
of Athens. And above all, he would feel sure that it had been erected
by the city at the public expense; or at all events by some public
decree; and then, again, when he heard it was the tomb of Pythionica
the courtesan, what must be his feelings?"</p>

<p>And Theopompus also, in his letter to Alexander, speaking reproachfully
of the profligacy of Harpalus, says,&mdash;"But just consider and listen to
the truth, as you may hear from the people of Babylon, as to the manner
in which he treated Pythionica when she was dead; who was originally

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 950]</span>

the slave of Bacchis, the female flute-player. And Bacchis herself
had been the slave of Sinope the Thracian, who brought her
establishment of harlots from Ægina to Athens; so that she was not only
trebly a slave, but also trebly a harlot. He, however, erected two
monuments to her at an expense exceeding two hundred talents. And every
one marvelled that no one of all those who died in Cilicia, in defence
of your dominions and of the freedom of the Greeks, had had any tomb
adorned for them either by him or by any other of the governors of the
state; but that a tomb should be erected to Pythionica the courtesan,
both in Athens and in Babylon; and they have now stood a long time.
For a man who ventured to call himself a friend to you, has dared to
consecrate a temple and a spot of ground to a woman whom everybody
knew to have been common to every one who chose at the same fixed
price, and to call both the temple and the altar those of Pythionica
Venus; and in so doing, he despised also the vengeance of the Gods, and
endeavoured to insult the honours to which you are entitled." Philemon
also mentions these circumstances, in his comedy called the Babylonian,
where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">You shall be queen of Babylon if the Fates</div>
    <div class="verse">Will but permit it. Sure you recollect</div>
    <div class="verse">Pythionica and proud Harpalus.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Alexis also mentions her in his Lyciscus.</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">COURTESANS.</div>

<p>68. But after the death of Pythionica, Harpalus sent for Glycera,
and she also was a courtesan, as Theopompus relates, when he says that
Harpalus issued an edict that no one should present him with a crown,
without at the same time paying a similar compliment to his prostitute;
and adds,&mdash;"He has also erected a brazen statue to Glycera in
Rhossus of Syria, where he intends to erect one of you, and another of
himself. And he has permitted her to dwell in the palace in Tarsus,
and he permits her to receive adoration from the people, and to bear
the title of Queen, and to be complimented with other presents, which
are only fit for your own mother and your own wife." And we have a
testimony coinciding with this from the author of the Satyric drama
called Agen, which was exhibited, on the occasion when the Dionysian
festival was celebrated on the banks of the river Hydaspes, by the
author, whether he was Pythen of Catana or
Byzantium, or the king himself. And it was exhibited when Harpalus was

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 951]</span>

now flying to the sea-shore, after he had revolted; and it mentions
Pythionica as already dead; and Glycera, as being with Harpalus, and as
being the person who encouraged the Athenians to receive presents from
Harpalus. And the verses of the play are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>69. Naucratis also has produced some very celebrated courtesans of
exceeding beauty; for instance, Doricha, whom the beautiful Sappho,
as she became the mistress of her brother Charaxus, who had gone to
Naucratis on some mercantile business, accuses in her poetry of having
stripped Charaxus of a great deal of his property. But Herodotus calls
her Rhodopis, being evidently ignorant that Rhodopis and Doricha
were two different people; and it was Rhodopis who dedicated those
celebrated spits at Delphi, which Cratinus mentions in the following
lines&mdash;</p>

<p>Posidippus also made this epigram on Doricha, although he had often
mentioned her in his Æthiopia, and this is the epigram&mdash;</p>

<p>Archedice also was a native of Naucratis; and she was a courtesan of
great beauty. "For some how or other," as Herodotus says, "Naucratis is
in the habit of producing beautiful courtesans."</p>

<p>70. There was also a certain courtesan named Sappho, a native of
Eresus, who was in love with the beautiful Phaon, and she was very
celebrated, as Nymphis relates in his Voyage round Asia. But Nicarete
of Megara, who was a courtesan, was not a woman of ignoble birth, but
she was born of free parents, and was very well calculated to excite
affection by reason of her accomplishments, and she was a pupil of
Stilpon the philosopher.</p>

<p>There was also Bilisticha the Argive, who was a very celebrated
courtesan, and who traced her descent back to the Atridæ, as those
historians relate who have written the history of the affairs of
Argolis. There was also a courtesan named Leæna, whose name is very
celebrated, and she was the mistress of Harmodius, who slew the tyrant.
And she, being tortured by command of Hippias the tyrant, died under
the torture without having said a word. Stratocles the orator also
had for his mistress a courtesan whose name was Leme,<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
and who was nicknamed Parorama, because she used to let whoever chose
come to her for two drachmas, as Gorgias says in his treatise on
Courtesans.</p>

<p>Now though Myrtilus appeared to be intending to say no more after
this, he resumed his subject, and said:&mdash;But I was nearly forgetting,
my friends, to tell you of the Lyda of Antimachus, and also of her
namesake Lyda, who was also a courtesan and the mistress of Lamynthius
the Milesian. For each of these poets, as Clearchus tells us in his
Tales of Love, being inflamed with love for the barbarian Lyde, wrote

<span class="pagenum">Pg 953]</span>

poems, the one in elegiac, and the other in lyric verse, and they both
entitled their poems "Lyde." I omitted also to mention the female
flute-player Nanno, the mistress of Mimnermus, and Leontium, the
mistress of Hermesianax of Colophon. For he inscribed with her name, as
she was his mistress, three books of elegiac poetry, in the third of
which he gives a catalogue of things relating to Love; speaking in the
following manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>72. But in this Hermesianax is mistaken when he represents Sappho and
Anacreon as contemporaries. For the one lived in the time of Cyrus and
Polycrates; but Sappho lived in the reign of Alyattes, the father of
Crœsus. But Chameleon, in his treatise on Sappho, does assert that some
people say that these verses were made upon her by Anacreon&mdash;</p>

<p>But it is plain enough in reality that this piece of poetry is not
Sappho's. And I think myself that Hermesianax is joking concerning the
love of Anacreon and Sappho. For Diphilus the comic poet, in his play
called Sappho, has represented Archilochus and Hipponax as the lovers
of Sappho.</p>

<p>Now it appears to me, my friends, that I have displayed some diligence
in getting up this amorous catalogue for you, as I myself am not a

<p>And, therefore, in the case of a young man who had every other
imaginable virtue, this one fault alone, that he did not honour Venus,
was the cause of his destruction. And neither Diana, who loved him
exceedingly, nor any other of the gods or demi-gods could defend him;

<p>75. But Archytas the Harmonist, as Chamæleon calls him, says that
Alcman was the original poet of amatory songs, and that he was the
first poet to introduce melodies inciting to lawless indulgence, ...
being, with respect to women.... On which account he says in one of his
odes&mdash;</p>

<p>He says also that he was in a moderate degree in love with
Megalostrate, who was a poetess, and who was able to allure lovers to
her by the charms of her conversation. And he speaks thus concerning
her&mdash;</p>

<p>And Stesichorus, who was in no moderate degree given to amorous
pursuits, composed many poems of this kind; which in ancient times were
called παιδιὰ and παιδικά. And, in fact, there was
such emulation about composing poems of this sort, and so far was any
one from thinking lightly of the amatory poets, that Æschylus, who was
a very great poet, and Sophocles, too, introduced the subject of the
loves of men on the stage in their tragedies: the one describing the
love of Achilles for Patroclus, and the other, in his Niobe, the mutual
love of her sons (on which account some men have given an ill name to
that tragedy); and all such passages as those are very agreeable to the
spectators.</p>

<p>77. And many men used to be as fond of having boys for their favourites
as women for their mistresses. And this was a frequent fashion in
many very well regulated cities of Greece. Accordingly, the Cretans,
as I have said before, and the Chalcidians in Eubœa, were very much
addicted to the custom of having boy-favourites. Therefore Echemenes,
in his History of Crete, says that it was not Jupiter who carried off
Ganymede, but Minos. But the before-mentioned Chalcidians say that

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 960]</span>

Ganymede was carried off from them by Jupiter; and they show the
spot, which they call Harpagius;<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
and it is a place which produces extraordinary myrtles. And Minos
abandoned his enmity to the Athenians, (although it had originated in
consequence of the death of his son, out of his love for Theseus: and
he gave his daughter Phædra to him for his wife,) as Zenis, or Zeneus,
the Chian, tells us in his treatise on Country.</p>

<p>78. But Hieronymus the Peripatetic says that the ancients were
anxious to encourage the practice of having boy-favourites, because
the vigorous disposition of youths, and the confidence engendered by
their association with each other, has often led to the overthrow of
tyrannies. For in the presence of his favourite, a man would choose to
do anything rather than to get the character of a coward. And this was
proved in practice in the case of the Sacred Band, as it was called,
which was established at Thebes by Epaminondas. And the death of the
Pisistratidæ was brought about by Harmodius and Aristogiton; and at
Agrigentum in Sicily, the mutual love of Chariton and Melanippus
produced a similar result, as we are told by Heraclides of Pontus, in
his treatise on Amatory Matters. For Melanippus and Chariton, being
informed against as plotting against Phalaris, and being put to the
torture in order to compel them to reveal their accomplices, not only
did not betray them, but even made Phalaris himself pity them, on
account of the tortures which they had undergone, so that he dismissed
them with great praise. On which account Apollo, being pleased at
this conduct, gave Phalaris a respite from death; declaring this to
the men who consulted the Pythian priestess as to how they might best
attack him. He also gave them an oracle respecting Chariton, putting
the Pentameter before the Hexameter, in the same way as afterwards
Dionysius the Athenian did, who was nicknamed the Brazen, in his
Elegies; and the oracle runs as follows&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Happy were Chariton and Melanippus,</div>
    <div class="verse">Authors of heavenly love to many men.</div>

<div class="sidenote-left">LOVE.</div>

<p>The circumstances, too, that happened to Cratinus the Athenian, are
very notorious. For he, being a very beautiful boy, at the time when
Epimenides was purifying Attica by human sacrifices, on account of
some old pollution, as Neanthes of Cyzicus relates in the second book
of his treatise on

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 961]</span>

Sacrifices, willingly gave himself up to secure the safety of the woman
who had brought him up. And after his death, Apollodorus, his friend,
also devoted himself to death, and so the calamities of the country
were terminated. And owing to favouritism of this kind, the tyrants
(for friendships of this sort were very adverse to their interests)
altogether forbad the fashion of making favourites of boys, and wholly
abolished it. And some of them even burnt down and rased to the ground
the palæstræ, considering them as fortresses hostile to their own
citadels; as, for instance, Polycrates the tyrant of Samos did.</p>

<p>79. But among the Spartans, as Agnon the Academic philosopher tells us,
girls and boys are all treated in the same way before marriage: for the
great lawgiver Solon has said&mdash;</p>

<p>and the other, in his Colchian Women, speaking of Ganymede, says&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse">Inflaming with his beauty mighty Jove.</div>

<p>But I am not ignorant that the stories which are told about Cratinus
and Aristodemus are stated by Polemo Periegetes, in his Replies to
Neanthes, to be all mere inventions. But you, O Cynulcus, believe that
all these stories are true, let them be ever so false. And you take
the greatest pleasure in all such poems as turn on boys and favourites
of that kind; while the fashion of making favourites of boys was first
introduced among the Grecians from Crete, as Timæus informs us. But
others say that Laius was the originator of this custom, when he was
received in hospitality by Pelops; and that he took a great fancy to
his son, Chrysippus, whom he put into his chariot and carried off, and
fled with to Thebes. But Praxilla the Sicyonian says that Chrysippus
was carried off by Jupiter. And the Celtæ, too, although they have the
most beautiful women of all the barbarians, still make great favourites
of boys.... And the Persians, according to the statement of Herodotus,
learnt from the Greeks to adopt this fashion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 962]</span></p>

<p>80. Alexander the king was also very much in the habit of giving
in to this fashion. Accordingly, Dicæarchus, in his treatise on the
Sacrifice at Troy, says that he was so much under the influence of
Bagoas the eunuch, that he embraced him in the sight of the whole
theatre; and that when the whole theatre shouted in approval of the
action, he repeated it. And Carystius, in his Historic Commentaries,
says,&mdash;"Charon the Chalcidian had a boy of great beauty, who was a
great favourite of his: but when Alexander, on one occasion, at a great
entertainment given by Craterus, praised this boy very much, Charon
bade the boy go and salute Alexander: and he said, 'Not so, for he will
not please me so much as he will vex you.' For though the king was of a
very amorous disposition, still he was at all times sufficiently master
of himself to have a due regard to decorum, and to the preservation of
appearances. And in the same spirit, when he had taken as prisoners
the daughters of Darius, and his wife, who was of extraordinary
beauty, he not only abstained from offering them any insult, but he
took care never to let them feel that they were prisoners at all; but
ordered them to be treated in every respect, and to be supplied with
everything, just as if Darius had still been in his palace; on which
account, Darius, when he heard of this conduct, raised his hands to the
Sun and prayed that either he might be king, or Alexander."</p>

<p>But Ibycus states that Talus was a great favourite of Rhadamanthus the
Just. And Diotimus, in his Heraclea, says that Eurystheus was a great
favourite of Hercules, on which account he willingly endured all his
labours for his sake. And it is said that Argynnus was a favourite of
Agamemnon; and that they first became acquainted from Agamemnon seeing
Argynnus bathing in the Cephisus. And afterwards, when he was drowned
in this river, (for he was continually bathing in it,) Agamemnon
buried him, and raised a temple on the spot to Venus Argynnis. But
Licymnius of Chios, in his Dithyrambics, says that it was Hymenæus
of whom Argynnus was a favourite. And Aristocles the harp-player was
a favourite of King Antigonus: and Antigonus the Carystian, in his
Life of Zeno, writes of him in the following terms:&mdash;"Antigonus the
king used often to go to sup with Zeno; and once, as he was returning
by daylight from some entertainment, he went to Zeno's house, and
persuaded him to go with him to sup with Aristocles the harp-player,
who was an excessive favourite of the king's."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 963]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">LOVE.</div>

<p>81. Sophocles, too, had a great fancy for having boy-favourites, equal
to the addiction of Euripides for women. And accordingly, Ion the poet,
in his book on the Arrival of Illustrious Men in the Island of Chios,
writes thus:&mdash;"I met Sophocles the poet in Chios, when he was sailing
to Lesbos as the general: he was a man very pleasant over his wine, and
very witty. And when Hermesilaus, who was connected with him by ancient
ties of hospitality, and who was also the proxenus<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
of the Athenians, entertained him, the boy who was mixing the wine was
standing by the fire, being a boy of a very beautiful complexion, but
made red by the fire: so Sophocles called him and said, 'Do you wish me
to drink with pleasure?' and when he said that he did, he said, 'Well,
then, bring me the cup, and take it away again in a leisurely manner.'
And as the boy blushed all the more at this, Sophocles said to the
guest who was sitting next to him, 'How well did Phrynichus speak when
he said&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 964]</span></p>

<p>And a man from Eretria, or from Erythræ, who was a schoolmaster,
answered him,&mdash;'You are a great man in poetry, O Sophocles; but still
Phrynichus did not say well when he called purple cheeks a mark of
beauty. For if a painter were to cover the cheeks of this boy with
purple paint he would not be beautiful at all. And so it is not well to
compare what is beautiful with what is not so.' And on this Sophocles,
laughing at the Eretrian, said,&mdash;'Then, my friend, I suppose you are
not pleased with the line in Simonides which is generally considered
among the Greeks to be a beautiful one&mdash;</p>

<p>And you do not either like the poet who spoke of the golden-haired
Apollo; for if a painter were to represent the hair of the god as
actually golden, and not black, the picture would be all the worse. Nor
do you approve of the poet who spoke of rosy-fingered.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> For if any
one were to dip his fingers in rosy-coloured paint he would make his
hands like those of a purple-dyer, and not of a pretty woman.' And when
they all laughed at this, the Eretrian was checked by the reproof; and
Sophocles again turned to pursue the conversation with the boy; for he
asked him, as he was brushing away the straws from the cup with his
little finger, whether he saw any straws: and when he said that he did,
he said, 'Blow them away, then, that you may not dirty your fingers.'
And when he brought his face near the cup he held the cup nearer to his
own mouth, so as to bring his own head nearer to the head of the boy.
And when he was very near he took him by the hand and kissed him. And
when all clapped their hands, laughing and shouting out, to see how
well he had taken the boy in, he said, 'I, my friends, am meditating
on the art of generalship, since Pericles has said that I know how to
compose poetry, but not how to be a general; now has not this stratagem
of mine succeeded perfectly?' And he both said and did many things of
this kind in a witty manner, drinking and giving himself up to mirth:
but as to political affairs he was not able nor energetic in them, but
behaved as any other virtuous Athenian might have done.</p>

<p>82. And Hieronymus of Rhodes, in his Historic Commentaries, says that
Sophocles was not always so moderate, but that he at times committed
greater excesses, and gave Euripides a handle to reproach him, as
bringing himself into disrepute by his excessive intemperance.</p>

<p>83. And Theopompus, in his treatise on the Treasures of which the
Temple at Delphi was plundered, says that "Asopichus, being a favourite
of Epaminondas, had the trophy of Leuctra represented in relief on his
shield, and that he encountered danger with extraordinary gallantry;
and that this shield is consecrated at Delphi, in the portico." And
in the same treatise, Theopompus further alleges that "Phayllus, the
tyrant of Phocis, was extremely addicted to women; but that Onomarchus
used to select boys as his favourites: and that he had a favourite,
the son of Pythodorus the Sicyonian, to whom, when he came to Delphi
to devote his hair to the god (and he was a youth of great beauty),
Onomarchus gave the offerings of the Sybarites&mdash;four golden combs.
And Phayllus gave to the daughter of Diniades, who was a female
flute-player, a Bromiadian,<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
a silver goblet of the Phocæans, and a golden crown of ivy-leaves, the
offering of the Peparethians. And," he says, "she was about to play
the flute at the Pythian games, if she had not been hindered by the
populace.</p>

<p>"Onomarchus also gave," as he says, "to his favourite Lycolas, and to
Physcidas the son of Tricholaus (who was very handsome), a crown of
laurel, the offering of the Ephesians. This boy was brought also to
Philip by his father, but was dismissed without any favour. Onomarchus
also gave to Damippus, the son of Epilycus of Amphipolis, who was a
youth of great beauty, a present which had been consecrated to the god
by Plisthenes.</p>

<p>"And Philomelus gave to Pharsalia, a dancing-woman from Thessaly,
a golden crown of laurel-leaves, which had been offered by the
Lampsacenes. But Pharsalia herself was afterwards torn to pieces at
Metapontum, by the soothsayers, in the market-place, on the occasion
of a voice coming forth out of the brazen laurel which the people of
Metapontum had set up at the time when Aristeas of Proconnesus was

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 966]</span>

sojourning among them, on his return, as he stated, from the
Hyperboreans, the first moment that she was seen entering the
market-place. And when men afterwards inquired into the reason for this
violence, she was found to have been put to death on account of this
crown which belonged to the god."</p>

<p>84. Now I warn you, O philosophers, who indulge in unnatural passions,
and who treat the great goddess Venus with impiety, to beware, lest
you be destroyed in the same manner. For boys are only handsome, as
Glycera the courtesan said, while they are like women: at least, this
is the saying attributed to her by Clearchus. But my opinion is that
the conduct of Cleonymus the Spartan was in strict conformity with
nature, who was the first man to take such hostages as he took from
the Metapontines&mdash;namely, two hundred of their most respectable and
beautiful virgins; as is related by Duris the Samian, in the third book
of his History of Agathocles. And I too, as is said by Epicrates in his
Antilais,</p>

<p>But you, my philosophical friends, even when you are in love with
women&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;as Clearchus says.
For a bull was excited by the sight of the brazen cow at Pirene: and
in a picture that existed of a bitch, and a pigeon, and a goose; and a
gander came up to the goose, and a dog to the bitch, and a male pigeon
to the pigeon, and not one of them discovered the deception till they
got close to them; but when they got near enough to touch them, they
desisted; just as Clisophus the Salymbrian did. For he fell in love
with a statue of Parian marble that then was at Samos, and shut himself
up in the temple to gratify his affection; but when he found that he
could make no impression on the coldness and unimpressibility of the
stone, then he discarded his passion. And Alexis the poet mentions this
circumstance in his drama entitled The Picture, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">And such another circumstance, they say,</div>
    <div class="verse">Took place in Samos: there a man did fall</div>
    <div class="verse">In love with a fair maiden wrought in marble,</div>
    <div class="verse">And shut himself up with her in the temple.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And Philemon mentions the same fact, and says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">But once a man, 'tis said, did fall, at Samos,</div>
    <div class="verse">In love with a marble woman; and he went</div>
    <div class="verse">And shut himself up with her in the temple.</div>

</div>


<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 967]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">LOVE.</div>

<p>But the statue spoken of is the work of Ctesicles; as Adæus of Mitylene
tells us in his treatise on Statuaries. And Polemo, or whoever the
author of the book called Helladicus is, says&mdash;"At Delphi, in the
museum of the pictures, there are two boys wrought in marble; one of
which, the Delphians say, was so fallen in love with by some one who
came to see it, that he made love to it, and shut himself up with
it, and presented it with a crown; but when he was detected, the god
ordered the Delphians, who consulted his oracle with reference to the
subject, to dismiss him freely, for that he had given him a handsome
reward.</p>

<p>85. And even brute beasts have fallen in love with men: for there was
a cock who took a fancy to a man of the name of Secundus, a cup-bearer
of the king; and the cock was nicknamed the Centaur. But this Secundus
was a slave of Nicomedes the king of Bithynia; as Nicander informs us
in the sixth book of his essay on the Revolutions of Fortune. And,
at Ægium, a goose took a fancy to a boy; as Clearchus relates in the
first book of his Amatory Anecdotes. And Theophrastus, in his essay
on Love, says that the name of this boy was Amphilochus, and that he
was a native of Olenus. And Hermeas the son of Hermodorus, who was a
Samian by birth, says that a goose also took a fancy to Lacydes the
philosopher. And in Leucadia (according to a story told by Clearchus),
a peacock fell so in love with a maiden there, that when she died, the
bird died too. There is a story also that, at Iasus, a dolphin took a
fancy to a boy (and this story is told by Duris, in the ninth book of
his History); and the subject of that book is the history of Alexander,
and the historian's words are these: "He likewise sent for the boy from
Iasus. For near Iasus there was a boy whose name was Dionysius, and he
once, when leaving the palæstra with the rest of the boys, went down to
the sea and bathed; and a dolphin came forward out of the deep water to
meet him, and taking him on his back, swam away with him a considerable
distance into the open sea, and then brought him back again to
land." But the dolphin is an animal which is very fond of men, and
very intelligent, and one very susceptible of gratitude. Accordingly
Phylarchus, in his twelfth book, says&mdash;"Coiranus the Milesian, when he

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 968]</span>

saw some fishermen who had caught a dolphin in a net, and who were
about to cut it up, gave them some money and bought the fish, and took
it down and put it back in the sea again. And after this it happened to
him to be shipwrecked near Myconos, and while every one else perished,
Coiranus alone was saved by a dolphin. And when, at last, he died of
old age in his native country, as it so happened that his funeral
procession passed along the sea-shore close to Miletus, a great shoal
of dolphins appeared on that day in the harbour, keeping only a very
little distance from those who were attending the funeral of Coiranus,
as if they also were joining in the procession and sharing in their
grief."</p>

<p>The same Phylarchus also relates, in the twentieth book of his History,
the great affection which was once displayed by an elephant for a boy.
And his words are these: "But there was a female elephant kept with
this elephant, and the name of the female elephant was Nicæa; and to
her the wife of the king of India, when dying, entrusted her child,
which was just a month old. And when the woman did die, the affection
for the child displayed by the beast was most extraordinary; for it
could not endure the child to be away; and whenever it did not see him,
it was out of spirits. And so, whenever the nurse fed the infant with
milk, she placed it in its cradle between the feet of the beast; and if
she had not done so, the elephant would not take any food; and after
this, it would take whatever reeds and grass there were near, and,
while the child was sleeping, beat away the flies with the bundle. And
whenever the child wept, it would rock the cradle with its trunk, and
lull it to sleep. And very often the male elephant did the same."</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">LOVE.</div>

<p>86. But you, O philosophers, are far fiercer than dolphins and
elephants, and are also much more untameable; although Persæus the
Cittiæan, in his Recollections of Banquets, says loudly,&mdash;"It is a
very consistent subject of conversation at drinking parties for men to
talk of amatory matters; for we are naturally inclined to such topics
after drinking. And at those times we should praise those who indulge
in that kind of conversation to a moderate and temperate degree, but
blame those who go to excess in it, and behave in a beastly manner.
But if logicians, when assembled in a social party, were to talk
about syllogisms, then a man might very fairly think that they were
acting very unseasonably. And a respectable and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 969]</span>

virtuous man will at times get drunk; but they who wish to appear
extraordinarily temperate, keep up this character amid their cups for
a certain time, but afterwards, as the wine begins to take effect
on them, they descend to every kind of impropriety and indecency.
And this was the case very lately with the ambassadors who came to
Antigonus from Arcadia; for they sat at dinner with great severity of
countenance, and with great propriety, as they thought,&mdash;not only not
looking at any one of us, but not even looking at one another. But as
the wine went round, and music of different kinds was introduced, and
when the Thessalian dancing-women, as their fashion is, came in, and
danced quite naked, except that they had girdles round their waists,
then the men could not restrain themselves any longer, but jumped
up off the couches, and shouted as if they were beholding a most
gratifying sight; and they congratulated the king because he had it in
his power to indulge in such pastimes; and they did and said a great
many more vulgar things of the same kind.</p>

<p>"And one of the philosophers who was once drinking with us, when a
flute-playing girl came in, and when there was plenty of room near him,
when the girl wished to sit down near him, would not allow her, but
drew himself up and looked grave. And then afterwards, when the girl
was put up to auction, as is often the fashion at such entertainments,
he was exceedingly eager to buy her, and quarrelled with the man who
sold her, on the ground that he had knocked her down too speedily to
some one else; and he said that the auctioneer had not fairly sold her.
And at last this grave philosopher, he who at first would not permit
the girl even to sit near him, came to blows about her." And perhaps
this very philosopher, who came to blows about the flute-playing girl,
may have been Persæus himself; for Antigonus the Carystian, in his
treatise on Zeno, makes the following statement:&mdash;"Zeno the Cittiæan,
when once Perseus at a drinking-party bought a flute-playing girl, and
after that was afraid to bring her home, because he lived in the same
house with Zeno, becoming acquainted with the circumstance, brought
the girl home himself, and shut her up with Persæus." I know, also,
that Polystratus the Athenian, who was a pupil of Theophrastus, and who
was surnamed the Tyrrhenian, used often to put on the garments of the
female flute-players.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 970]</span></p>

<p>87. Kings, too, have shown great anxiety about musical women; as
Parmenion tells us in his Letter to Alexander, which he sent to that
monarch after he had taken Damascus, and after he had become master
of all the baggage of Darius. Accordingly, having enumerated all the
things which he had taken, he writes as follows:&mdash;"I found three
hundred and twenty-nine concubines of the king, all skilled in music;
and forty-six men who were skilful in making garlands, and two hundred
and seventy-seven confectioners, and twenty-nine boilers of pots, and
thirteen cooks skilful in preparing milk, and seventeen artists who
mixed drinks, and seventy slaves who strain wine, and forty preparers
of perfumes." And I say to you, O my companions, that there is no sight
which has a greater tendency to gladden the eyes than the beauty of
a woman. Accordingly Œneus, in the play of Chæremon the tragedian,
speaking of some maidens whom he had seen, says, in the play called
Œneus,&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse">E'en an old bard may sing of memory)</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>There was, for instance, Thargelia the Milesian, who was married
to fourteen different husbands, so very beautiful and accomplished
was she, as Hippias the Sophist says, in his book which is entitled
Synagoge. But Dinon, in the fifth book of his History of Persia, and
in the first part of it, says that the wife of Bagazus, who was a
sister of Xerxes by the same father, (and her name was Anytis,) was the
most beautiful and the most licentious of all the women in Asia. And
Phylarchus, in his nineteenth book, says that Timosa, the concubine of
Oxyartes, surpassed all women in beauty, and that the king of Egypt had
originally sent her as a present to Statira, the wife of the king.</p>

<p>And Theopompus, in the fifty-sixth book of his History, speaks of
Xenopithea, the mother of Lysandrides, as the most beautiful of all
the women in Peloponnesus. And the Lacedæmonians put her to death,
and her sister Chryse also, when Agesilaus the king, having raised a
seditious tumult in the city, procured Lysandrides, who was his enemy,
to be banished by the Lacedæmonians. Pantica of Cyprus was also a

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 972]</span>

very beautiful woman; and she is mentioned by Phylarchus, in the tenth
book of his History, where he says that when she was with Olympias,
the mother of Alexander, Monimus, the son of Pythion, asked her in
marriage. And, as she was a very licentious woman, Olympias said to
him&mdash;"O wretched man, you are marrying with your eyes, and not with
your understanding." They also say that the woman who brought back
Pisistratus to assume the tyranny, clad in the semblance of Minerva the
Saviour, was very beautiful, as indeed she ought to have been, seeing
that she assumed the appearance of a goddess. And she was a seller of
garlands; and Pisistratus afterwards gave her in marriage to Hipparchus
his son, as Clidemus relates in the eighth book of his Returns, where
he says&mdash;"And he also gave the woman, by name Phya, who had been in
the chariot with him, in marriage to his son Hipparchus. And she was
the daughter of a man named Socrates. And he took for Hippias, who
succeeded him in the tyranny, the daughter of Charmus the polemarch,
who was extraordinarily beautiful."</p>

<p>And it happened, as it is said, that Charmus was a great admirer of
Hippias, and that he was the man who first erected a statue of Love in
the Academy, on which there is the following inscription&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">

<p>for the women there are very beautiful, as Theophrastus also asserts.
And Nymphodorus, in his Voyage round Asia, says that there are nowhere
more beautiful women than those in Tenedos, an island close to Troy.</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">PRAISE OF MODESTY.</div>

<p>90. I am aware, too, that on one occasion there was a contest of
beauty instituted among women. And Nicias, speaking of it in his
History of Arcadia, says that Cypselus instituted it, having built
a city in the plain which is watered by the Alpheus; in which he
established some Parrhasians, and consecrated a plot of sacred ground
and an altar to Ceres of Eleusis, in whose festival it was that he
had instituted this contest of beauty. And he says that the woman who
gained the victory in this contest was Herodice.

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 973]</span>

And even to this day this contest is continued; and the women who
contend in it are called Goldbearing. And Theophrastus says that there
is also a contest of beauty which takes place among the Eleans, and
that the decision is come to with great care and deliberation; and that
those who gain the victory receive arms as their prize, which Dionysius
of Leuctra says are offered up to Minerva. And he says, too, that the
victor is adorned with fillets by his friends, and goes in procession
to the temple; and that a crown of myrtle is given to him (at least
this is the statement of Myrsilus, in his Historical Paradoxes). "But
in some places," says the same Theophrastus, "there are contests
between the women in respect of modesty and good management, as there
are among the barbarians; and at other places also there are contests
about beauty, on the ground that this also is entitled to honour,
as for instance, there are in Tenedos and Lesbos. But they say that
this is the gift of chance, or of nature; but that the honour paid
to modesty ought to be one of a greater degree. For that it is in
consequence of modesty that beauty is beautiful; for without modesty it
is apt to be subdued by intemperance."</p>

<p>91. Now, when Myrtilus had said all this in a connected statement; and
when all were marvelling at his memory, Cynulcus said&mdash;</p>

<p>For what is the use of so many names, my good grammarian, which are
more calculated to overwhelm the hearers than to do them any good? And
if any one were to inquire of you, who they were who were shut up in
the wooden horse, you would perhaps be able to tell the names of one or
two; and even this you would not do out of the verses of Stesichorus,
(for that could hardly be,) but out of the Storming of Troy, by
Sacadas the Argive; for he has given a catalogue of a great number of
names. Nor indeed could you properly give a list of the companions of

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 974]</span>

Ulysses, and say who they were who were devoured by the Cyclops, or
by the Læstrygonians, and whether they were really devoured or not.
And you do not even know this, in spite of your frequent mention of
Phylarchus, that in the cities of the Ceans it is not possible to see
either courtesans or female flute-players. And Myrtilus said,&mdash;But
where has Phylarchus stated this? For I have read through all his
history. And when he said,&mdash;In the twenty-third book; Myrtilus said&mdash;</p>

<p>92. Do I not then deservedly detest all you philosophers, since you are
all haters of philology,&mdash;men whom not only did Lysimachus the king

Romans, who are in every respect the best of men, banished all the
sophists from Rome, on the ground of their corrupting the youth of the

<p>It is, therefore, with good reason that many cities, and especially the
city of the Lacedæmonians, as Chamæleon says in his book on Simonides,
will not admit either rhetoric or philosophy, on account of the
jealousy, and strife, and profitless discussions to which they give
rise; owing to which it was that Socrates was put to death; he, who argued

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 975]</span>

against the judges who were given him by lot, discoursing of justice
to them when they were a pack of most corrupt men. And it is owing
to this, too, that Theodorus the Atheist was put to death, and that
Diagoras was banished; and this latter, sailing away when he was
banished, was wrecked. But Theotimus, who wrote the books against
Epicurus, was accused by Zeno the Epicurean, and put to death; as is
related by Demetrius the Magnesian, in his treatise on People and
Things which go by the same Name.</p>

<p>93. And, in short, according to Clearchus the Solensian, you do not
adopt a manly system of life, but you do really aim at a system which
might become a dog; but although this animal has four excellent
qualities, you select none but the worst of his qualities for your
imitation. For a dog is a wonderful animal as to his power of smelling
and of distinguishing what belongs to his own family and what does not;
and the way in which he associates with man, and the manner in which
he watches over and protects the houses of all those who are kind to
him, is extraordinary. But you who imitate the dogs, do neither of
these things. For you do not associate with men, nor do you distinguish
between those with whom you are acquainted; and being very deficient
in sensibility, you live in an indolent and indifferent manner. But
while the dog is also a snarling and greedy animal, and also hard in
his way of living, and naked; these habits of his you practise, being
abusive and gluttonous, and, besides all this, living without a home
or a hearth. The result of all which circumstances is, that you are
destitute of virtue, and quite unserviceable for any useful purpose in
life. For there is nothing less philosophical than those persons who
are called philosophers. For whoever supposed that Æschines, the pupil
of Socrates, would have been such a man in his manners as Lysias the
orator, in his speeches on the Contracts, represents him to have been;
when, out of the dialogues which are extant, and generally represented
to be his work, we are inclined to admire him as an equitable and
moderate man? unless, indeed, those writings are in reality the work of
the wise Socrates, and were given to Æschines by Xanthippe, the wife of
Socrates, after his death, which Idomeneus asserts to be the case.</p>

<p>94. But Lysias, in the oration which bears this title&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 976]</span></p>

<p>"Against Æschines, the Pupil of Socrates, for Debt," (for I will recite the
passage, even though it be a rather long one, on account of your
excessive arrogance, O philosophers,)&mdash;begins in the following
manner&mdash;"I never should have imagined, O judges, that Æschines would
have dared to come into court on a trial which is so discreditable to
him. For a more disgracefully false accusation than the one which he
has brought forward, I do not believe it to be easy to find. For he,
O judges, owing a sum of money with a covenanted interest of three
drachmæ to Sosinomus the banker and Aristogiton, came to me, and
besought me not to allow him to be wholly stripped of his own property,
in consequence of this high interest. 'And I,' said he, 'am at this
moment carrying on the trade of a perfumer; but I want capital to go
on with, and I will pay you nine<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
obols a month interest.'" A fine end to the happiness of this
philosopher was the trade of a perfumer, and admirably harmonizing
with the philosophy of Socrates, a man who utterly rejected the use of
all perfumes and unguents! And moreover, Solon the lawgiver expressly
forbade a man to devote himself to any such business: on which account
Pherecrates, in his Oven, or Woman sitting up all Night, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Why should he practise a perfumer's trade,</div>

    <div class="verse">Preparing for himself a seat on which</div>
    <div class="verse">To gossip with the youths the whole day long?</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And presently afterwards he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">And no one ever saw a female cook</div>

   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote-left">LENDING MONEY.</div>

<p>And after what I have already quoted, the orator proceeds to
say&mdash;"And I was persuaded by this speech of his, considering also
that this Æschines had been the pupil of Socrates,
and was a man who uttered fine sentiments about

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 977]</span>

virtue and justice, and who would never attempt nor venture on the
actions practised by dishonest and unjust men."</p>

<p>95. And after this again, after he had run through the accusation of
Æschines, and had explained how he had borrowed the money, and how he
never paid either interest or principal, and how, when an action was
brought against him, he had allowed judgment to go by default, and how
a branded slave of his had been put forward by him as security; and
after he had brought a good many more charges of the same kind against
him, he thus proceeded:&mdash;"But, O judges, I am not the only person to
whom he behaves in this manner, but he treats every one who has any
dealings with him in the same manner. Are not even all the wine-sellers
who live near him, from whom he gets wine for his entertainments
and never pays for it, bringing actions against him, having already
closed their shops against him? And his neighbours are ill-treated
by him to such a degree that they leave their own houses, and go and
rent others which are at a distance from him. And with respect to all
the contributions which he collects, he never himself puts down the
remaining share which is due from him, but all the money which ever
gets into this pedlar's hands is lost as if it were utterly destroyed.
And such a number of men come to his house daily at dawn, to ask for
their money which he owes them, that passers-by suppose he must be
dead, and that such a crowd can only be collected to attend his funeral.</p>

<p>"And those men who live in the Piræus have such an opinion of him, that
they think it a far less perilous business to sail to the Adriatic
than to deal with him; for he thinks that all that he can borrow is
much more actually his own than what his father left him. Has he not
got possession of the property of Hermæus the perfumer, after having
seduced his wife, though she was seventy years old? whom he pretended
to be in love with, and then treated in such a manner that she reduced
her husband and her sons to beggary, and made him a perfumer instead
of a pedlar! in so amorous a manner did he handle the damsel, enjoying
the fruit of her youth, when it would have been less trouble to him to
count her teeth than the fingers of her hand, they were so much fewer.
And now come forward, you witnesses, who will prove these facts.&mdash;This,
then, is the life of this sophist."</p>

A σκολιὸν was a song which went round at banquets, sung to the
lyre by the guests, one after another, said to have been introduced
by Terpander; but the word is first found in Pind. Fr. lxxxvii. 9;
Aristoph. Ach. 532. The name is of uncertain origin: some refer it
to the character of the music, νόμος σκολιὸς, as opposed
to νόμος ὔρθιος; others to the ῥυθμὸς σκολιὸς,
or amphibrachic rhythm recognised in many scolia; but most, after
Dicæarchus and Plutarch, from the irregular zigzag way it went round
the table, each guest who sung holding a myrtle-branch, which he passed
on to any one he chose.&mdash;Lid. &amp; Scott, Gr. Lex. <i>in voc.</i></p>

"Of far greater importance was the public hospitality
(προξενία) which existed between two states, or between an
individual or a family on the one hand, and a whole state on the
other.... When two states established public hospitality, it was
necessary that in each state persons should be appointed to show
hospitality to, and watch over the interests of all persons who came
from the state connected by hospitality. The persons who were appointed
to this office, as the recognised agents of the state for which they
acted, were called πρόξενοι....</p>

<p>"The office of πρόξενοσ, which bears great resemblance to that
of a modern consul, or minister resident, was in some cases hereditary
in a particular family. When a state appointed a proxenus, it either
sent out one of its own citizens to reside in the other state, or it
selected one of the citizens of the other, and conferred on him the
honour of proxenus.... This custom seems in later times to have been
universally adopted by the Greeks....
</p>

<p>"The principal duties of a proxenus were to receive those persons,
especially ambassadors, who came from the state which he represented;
to procure for them admission to the assembly, and seats in the
theatre; to act as the patron of the strangers, and to mediate between
the two states, if any dispute arose. If a stranger died in the state,
the proxenus of his country had to take care of the property of the
deceased. The proxenus usually enjoyed exemption from taxes; and their
persons were inviolable both by sea and land."&mdash;Smith, Dict. Ant. v.

This would have been 18 per cent. Three drachmæ were about 36 per cent.
The former appears to have been the usual rate of interest at Athens in
the time of Lysias; for we find in Demosthenes that interest ἐπὶ δραχμῇ , that is to say, a drachma a month interest for each mina
lent, was considered low. It was exceedingly common, however, among
the money-lenders, to exact an exorbitant rate of interest, going even
as high as a drachma every four days.&mdash;See Smith's Dict. Ant. v.

<p>For when the wine has penetrated down into the body, as Herodotus says,
bad and furious language is apt to rise to the surface. And Clearchus

<p>And Xenophon represents Agesilaus as insisting that a man ought to
shun drunkenness equally with madness, and immoderate gluttony as much

nor of the number of those who are in the habit of being intoxicated by
midday, have come rather to this literary entertainment; for Ulpian,
who is always finding fault, reproved some one just now who said, I am
not drunk (ἔξοινος), saying,&mdash;Where do you find that word
ἔξοινος? But he rejoined,&mdash;Why, in Alexis, who, in his

<p>2. But as, after the discussion by us of the new topics which arise,
our liberal entertainer Laurentius is every day constantly introducing
different kinds of music, and also jesters and buffoons, let us have
a little talk about them. Although I am aware that Anacharsis the
Scythian, when on one occasion jesters were introduced in his company,
remained without moving a muscle of his countenance; but afterwards,
when a monkey was brought in, he burst out laughing, and said, "Now
this fellow is laughable by his nature, but man is only so through
practice." And Euripides, in his Melanippe in Chains, has said&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">But many men, from the wish to raise a laugh,</div>
    <div class="verse">Practise sharp sayings; but those sorry jesters</div>
    <div class="verse">I hate who let loose their unbridled tongues</div>
    <div class="verse">Against the wise and good; nor do I class them</div>
    <div class="verse">As men at all, but only as jokes and playthings.</div>
    <div class="verse">Meantime they live at ease, and gather up</div>
    <div class="verse">Good store of wealth to keep within their houses.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And Parmeniscus of Metapontum, as Semus tells us in the fifth book of
his Delias, a man of the highest consideration both as to family and
in respect of his riches, having gone down to the cave of Trophonius,
after he had come up again, was not able to laugh at all. And when he
consulted the oracle on this subject, the Pythian priestess replied to
him&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">You're asking me, you laughless man,</div>
    <div class="verse">About the power to laugh again;</div>
    <div class="verse">Your mother 'll give it you at home,</div>
    <div class="verse">If you with reverence to her come.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>So, on this, he hoped that when he returned to his country he should be
able to laugh again; but when he found that he could laugh no more now
than he could before, he considered that he had been deceived; till,
by some chance, he came to Delos; and as he was admiring everything he
saw in the island, he came into the temple of Latona, expecting to see
some very superb statue of the mother of Apollo; but when he saw only a
wooden shapeless figure, he unexpectedly burst out laughing. And then,
comparing what had happened with the oracle of the god, and being cured
of his infirmity, he honoured the goddess greatly.</p>

<p>3. Now Anaxandrides, in his Old-Man's Madness, says that it was
Rhadamanthus and Palamedes who invented the fashion of jesters; and his
words are these:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 980]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">And yet we labour much.</div>
    <div class="verse">But Palamedes first, and Rhadamanthus,</div>
    <div class="verse">Sought those who bring no other contribution,</div>
    <div class="verse">But say amusing things.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Xenophon also, in his Banquet, mentions jesters; introducing Philip, of
whom he speaks in the following manner:&mdash;"But Philip the jester, having
knocked at the door, told the boy who answered, to tell the guests who
he was, and that he was desirous to be admitted; and he said that he
came provided with everything which could qualify him for supping at
other people's expense. And he said, too, that his boy was in a good
deal of distress because he had brought nothing, and because he had had
no dinner." And Hippolochus the Macedonian, in his epistle to Lynceus,
mentions the jesters Mandrogenes and Strato the Athenian. And at Athens
there was a great deal of this kind of cleverness. Accordingly, in the
Heracleum at Diomea<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
they assembled to the number of sixty, and they were always spoken
of in the city as amounting to that number, in such expressions
as&mdash;"The sixty said this," and, "I am come from the sixty." And
among them were Callimedon, nicknamed the Crab, and Dinias, and also
Mnasigeiton and Menæchmus, as Telephanes tells us in his treatise on
the City. And their reputation for amusing qualities was so great, that
Philip the Macedonian heard of it, and sent them a talent to engage
them to write out their witticisms and send them to him. And the fact
of this king having been a man who was very fond of jokes is testified
to us by Demosthenes the orator in his Philippics.</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">JESTERS.</div>

<p>Demetrius Poliorcetes was a man very eager for anything which could
make him laugh, as Phylarchus tells us in the sixth book of his
History. And he it was who said, "that the palace of Lysimachus was in
no respect different from a comic theatre; for that there was no one
there bigger than a dissyllable;"<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
(meaning to laugh at Bithys and Paris, who had more influence than
anybody with Lysimachus, and at some others of his friends;) "but that
his friends were

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 981]</span>

Peucesteses, and Menelauses, and Oxythemises." But when Lysimachus
heard this, he said,&mdash;"I, however, never saw a prostitute on the stage
in a tragedy;" referring to Lamia the female flute-player. And when
this was reported to Demetrius, he rejoined,&mdash;"But the prostitute who
is with me, lives in a more modest manner than the Penelope who is with
him."</p>

<p>4. And we have mentioned before this that Sylla, the general of the
Romans, was very fond of anything laughable. And Lucius Anicius, who
was also a general of the Romans, after he had subdued the Illyrians,
and brought with him Genthius the king of the Illyrians as his
prisoner, with all his children, when he was celebrating his triumphal
games at Rome, did many things of the most laughable character
possible, as Polybius relates in his thirtieth book:&mdash;"For having
sent for the most eminent artists from Greece, and having erected a
very large theatre in the circus, he first of all introduced all the
flute-players. And these were Theodorus the Bœotian, and Theopompus,
and Hermippus, surnamed Lysimachus, who were the most eminent men in
their profession. And having brought these men in front of the stage
after the chorus was over, he ordered them all to play the flute. And
as they accompanied their music with appropriate gestures, he sent to
them and said that they were not playing well, and desired them to be
more vehement. And while they were in perplexity, one of the lictors
told them that what Anicius wished was that they should turn round
so as to advance towards each other, and give a representation of a
battle. And then the flute-players, taking this hint, and adopting a
movement not unsuited to their habitual wantonness, caused a great
tumult and confusion; and turning the middle of the chorus towards
the extremities, the flute-players, all blowing unpremeditated notes,
and letting their flutes be all out of tune, rushed upon one another
in turn: and at the same time the choruses, all making a noise to
correspond to them, and coming on the stage at the same time, rushed
also upon one another, and then again retreated, advancing and
retreating alternately. But when one of the chorus-dancers tucked up
his garment, and suddenly turned round and raised his hands against
the flute-player who was coming towards him, as if he was going to box

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 982]</span>

with him, then there arose an extraordinary clapping and shouting on
the part of the spectators. And while all these men were fighting as
if in regular battle, two dancers were introduced into the orchestra
with a symphony, and four boxers mounted the stage, with trumpeters
and horn-players: and when all these men were striving together, the
spectacle was quite indescribable: and as for the tragedians," says
Polybius, "if I were to attempt to describe what took place with
respect to them, I should be thought by some people to be jesting."</p>

<p>5. Now when Ulpian had said thus much, and when all were laughing at
the idea of this exhibition of Anicius, a discussion arose about the
men who are called πλάνοι. And the question was asked, Whether
there was any mention of these men in any of the ancient authors? for
of the jugglers (θαυματοποιοὶ) we have already spoken: and
Magnus said,&mdash;Dionysius of Sinope, the comic poet, in his play entitled
the Namesakes, mentions Cephisodorus the πλάνος in the
following terms:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">They say that once there was a man at Athens,</div>
    <div class="verse">A πλάνος, named Cephisodorus, who</div>
    <div class="verse">Devoted all his life to this pursuit;</div>
    <div class="verse">And he, whenever to a hill he came,</div>
    <div class="verse">Ran straight up to the top; but then descending</div>
    <div class="verse">Came slowly down, and leaning on a stick.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And Nicostratus also mentions him in his Syrian&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">They say the πλάνος Cephisodorus once</div>
    <div class="verse">Most wittily station'd in a narrow lane</div>
    <div class="verse">A crowd of men with bundles of large faggots,</div>
    <div class="verse">So that no one else could pass that way at all.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>There was also a man named Pantaleon, who is mentioned, by Theognetus,
in his Slave devoted to his Master&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Pantaleon himself did none deceive (ἐπλάνα)</div>
    <div class="verse">Save only foreigners, and those, too, such</div>
    <div class="verse">As ne'er had heard of him: and often he,</div>
    <div class="verse">After a drunken revel, would pour forth</div>
    <div class="verse">All sorts of jokes, striving to raise a laugh</div>
    <div class="verse">By his unceasing chattering.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote-left">JESTERS.</div>

<p>And Chrysippus the philosopher, in the fifth book of his treatise on
Honour and Pleasure, writes thus of Pantaleon:&mdash;"But Pantaleon the
πλάνος, when he was at the point of death, deceived every one
of his sons separately, telling each of them that he was the only one
to whom he was revealing the place where he had buried his gold; so
that they afterwards

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 983]</span>

went and dug together to no purpose, and then found out that they had
been all deceived."</p>

<p>6. And our party was not deficient in men fond of raising a laugh
by bitter speeches. And respecting a man of this kind, Chrysippus
subsequently, in the same book, writes as follows:&mdash;"Once when a man
fond of saying bitter things was about to be put to death by the
executioner, he said that he wished to die like the swan, singing a
song; and when he gave him leave, he ridiculed him." And Myrtilus
having had a good many jokes cut on him by people of this sort, got
angry, and said that Lysimachus the king had done a very sensible
thing; for he, hearing Telesphorus, one of his lieutenants, at an
entertainment, ridiculing Arsinoe (and she was the wife of Lysimachus),
as being a woman in the habit of vomiting, in the following line&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">You begin ill, introducing τηνδεμουσαν,<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>&mdash;</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>ordered him to be put in a cage (γαλεάγρα) and carried about
like a wild beast, and fed; and he punished him in this way till he
died. But if you, O Ulpian, raise a question about the word γαλεάγρα,
it occurs in Hyperides the orator; and the passage you may
find out for yourself.</p>

<p>And Tachaos the king of Egypt ridiculed Agesilaus king of Lacedæmon,
when he came to him as an ally (for he was a very short man), and lost
his kingdom in consequence, as Agesilaus abandoned his alliance. And
the expression of Tachaos was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">The mountain was in labour; Jupiter</div>
    <div class="verse">Was greatly frighten'd: lo! a mouse was born.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And Agesilaus hearing of this, and being indignant at it, said, "I will
prove a lion to you." So afterwards, when the Egyptians revolted (as
Theopompus relates, and Lyceas of Naucratis confirms the statement in
his History of Egypt), Agesilaus refused to cooperate with him, and, in
consequence, Tachaos lost his kingdom, and fled to the Persians.</p>

<p>7. So as there was a great deal of music introduced, and not always
the same instruments, and as there was a good deal of discussion and
conversation about them, (without always giving the names of those who
took part in it,) I will enumerate the chief things which were said.

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 984]</span>

For concerning flutes, somebody said that Melanippides, in his Marsyas,
disparaging the art of playing the flute, had said very cleverly about
Minerva:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Minerva cast away those instruments</div>
    <div class="verse">Down from her sacred hand; and said, in scorn,</div>

    <div class="verse">Shall I now yield myself to such malpractices?"</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And some one, replying to him, said,&mdash;But Telestes of Selinus, in
opposition to Melanippides, says in his Argo (and it is of Minerva that
he too is speaking):&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">

   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">It seems to me a scarcely credible thing</div>
    <div class="verse">That the wise Pallas, holiest of goddesses,</div>

    <div class="verse">Into an unseemly shape, to be a glory</div>
    <div class="verse">To the nymph-born, noisy monster Marsyas.</div>
    <div class="verse">For how should chaste Minerva be so anxious</div>

<p>intimating his belief that she, as she was and always was to continue a

    <div class="verse">But this report, spread by vain-speaking men,</div>

   </div>
  </div>

<p>And after this, in an express panegyric on the art of flute-playing, he
says&mdash;</p>

<p>9. And of the union of flutes with the lyre (for that concert has often
been a great delight to us ourselves), Ephippus, in his Traffic, speaks
as follows:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse">Clearly, O youth, the music of the flute,</div>

<p>And the exact meaning of the word συναυλία is shown by Semus
the Delian, in the fifth book of his Delias, where he writes&mdash;"But
as the term 'concert' (συναυλία) is not understood by many
people, we must speak of it. It is when there is a union of the flute
and of rhythm in alternation, without any words accompanying the
melody." And Antiphanes explains it very neatly in his Flute-player,

<p>But the poets frequently call the flute "the Libyan flute," as Duris
remarks in the second book of his History of Agathocles, because
Seirites, who appears to have been the first inventor of the art of
flute-playing, was a Libyan, of one of the Nomad tribes; and he was the
first person who played airs on the flute in the festival of Cybele.
And the different kinds of airs which can be played on the flute (as
Tryphon tells us in the second book of his treatise on Names) have
the following names:&mdash;the Comus, the Bucoliasmus, the Gingras, the
Tetracomus, the Epiphallus, the Choreus, the Callinicus, the Martial,
the Hedycomus, the Sicynnotyrbe, the Thyrocopicum, which is the same as
the Crousithyrum (or Door-knocker), the Cnismus, the Mothon. And all
these airs on the flute, when played, were accompanied with dancing.</p>

<p>10. Tryphon also gives a list of the different names of songs, as
follows. He says&mdash;"There is the Himæus, which is also called the
Millstone song, which men used to sing while grinding corn, perhaps
from the word ἱμαλίς. But ἱμαλὶς is a Dorian word, signifying a return,
and also the quantity of corn which the millers gave into the bargain.
Then there is the Elinus, which is the song of the men who worked
at the loom; as Epicharmus shows us in his Atalantas. There is also
the Ioulos, sung by the women who spin. And Semus the Delian, in his
treatise on Pæans, says&mdash;"They used to call the handfuls of barley
taken separately, ἀμάλαι; but when they were collected so that a great
many were made into one sheaf, then they were called οὔλοι and ἴουλοι.
And Ceres herself was called sometimes Chloe, and sometimes Ioulo; and,
as being the inventions of this goddess, both the fruits of the ground
and also the songs addressed to the goddess were called οὖλοι and
ἴουλοι: and so, too, we have the words δημήτρουλοι and καλλίουλοι, and
the line&mdash;</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote-left">SONGS.</div>

<p>But others say that the Ioulis is the song of the workers in

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 987]</span>

wool. There are also the songs of nurses, which are called
καταβαυκαλήσεις. There was also a song used at the feast of Swings,<a
name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67"
class="fnanchor">[67]</a> in honour of Erigone, which is called Aletis.
At all events, Aristotle says, in his treatise on the Constitution of
the Colophonians&mdash;"Theodoras also himself died afterwards by a
violent death. And he is said to have been a very luxurious man, as is
evident from his poetry; for even now the women sing his songs on the
festival of the Swing."</p>

<p>There was also a reaper's song called Lityerses; and another song
sung by hired servants when going to the fields, as Teleclides tells
us in his Amphictyons. There were songs, too, of bathing men, as we
learn from Crates in his Deeds of Daring; and a song of women baking,
as Aristophanes intimates in his Thesmophoriazusæ, and Nicochares in
his Hercules Choregus. And another song in use among those who drove
herds, and this was called the Bucoliasmus. And the man who first
invented this species of song was Diomus, a Sicilian cowherd; and it is
mentioned by Epicharmus in his Halcyon, and in his Ulysses Shipwrecked.
The song used at deaths and in mourning is called Olophyrmus; and the
songs called Iouli are used in honour of Ceres and Proserpine. The
song sung in honour of Apollo is called Philhelias, as we learn from
Telesilla; and those addressed to Diana are called Upingi.</p>

<p>There were also laws composed by Charondas, which were sung at Athens
at drinking parties; as Hermippus tells us in the sixth book of his
treatise on Lawgivers. And Aristophanes, in his catalogue of Attic
Expressions, says&mdash;"The Himæus is the song of people grinding; the
Hymenæus is the song used at marriage-feasts; and that employed in
lamentation is called Ialemus. But the Linus and the Ælinus are not
confined to occasions of mourning, but are in use also in good fortune,
as we may gather from Euripides."</p>

<p>11. But Clearchus, in the first book of his treatise on matters
relating to Love, says that there was a kind of song called Nomium,
derived from Eriphanis; and his words are these:&mdash;"Eriphanis was a
lyric poetess, the mistress of Menalcas the hunter; and she, pursuing
him with her passions, hunted too. For often frequenting the mountains,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 988]</span>

and wandering over them, she came to the different groves, equalling in her
wanderings the celebrated journeys of Io; so that not only those men
who were most remarkable for their deficiency in the tender passion,
but even the fiercest beasts, joined in weeping for her misfortunes,
perceiving the lengths to which her passionate hopes carried her.
Therefore she wrote poems; and when she had composed them, as it is
said, she roamed about the desert, shouting and singing the kind of
song called Nomium, in which the burden of the song is&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">The lofty oaks, Menalcas."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And Aristoxenus, in the fourth book of his treatise on Music,
says&mdash;"Anciently the women used to sing a kind of song called Calyca.
Now, this was a poem of Stesichorus, in which a damsel of the name
of Calyca, being in love with a young man named Euathlus, prays in a
modest manner to Venus to aid her in becoming his wife. But when the
young man scorned her, she threw herself down a precipice. And this
disaster took place near Leucas. And the poet has represented the
disposition of the maiden as very modest; so that she was not willing
to live with the youth on his own terms, but prayed that, if possible,
she might become the wedded wife of Euathlus; and if that were not
possible, that she might be released from life." But, in his Brief
Memoranda, Aristoxenus says&mdash;"Iphiclus despised Harpalyce, who was in
love with him; but she died, and there has been a contest established
among the virgins of songs in her honour, and the contest is called
from her, Harpalyce." And Nymphis, in the first book of his History
of Heraclea, speaking of the Maryandyni, says&mdash;"And in the same way
it is well to notice some songs which, in compliance with a national
custom, they sing, in which they invoke some ancient person, whom they
address as Bormus. And they say that he was the son of an illustrious
and wealthy man, and that he was far superior to all his fellows in
beauty and in the vigour of youth; and as he was superintending the
cultivation of some of his own lands, and wishing to give his reapers
something to drink, he went to fetch some water, and disappeared.
Accordingly, they say that on this the natives of the country sought
him with a kind of dirge and invocation set to music, which even to
this day they are in the habit of using frequently. And a

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 989]</span>

similar kind of song is that which is in use among the Egyptians, and
is called Maneros."</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">RHAPSODISTS.</div>

<p>12. Moreover, there were rhapsodists also present at our
entertainments: for Laurentius delighted in the reciters of Homer to
an extraordinary degree; so that one might call Cassander the king of
Macedonia a trifler in comparison of him; concerning whom Carystius, in
his Historic Recollections, tells us that he was so devoted to Homer,
that he could say the greater part of his poems by heart; and he had a
copy of the Iliad and the Odyssey written out with his own hand. And
that these reciters of Homer were called Homeristæ also, Aristocles
has told us in his treatise on Choruses. But those who are now called
Homeristæ were first introduced on the stage by Demetrius Phalereus.</p>

<p>Now Chamæleon, in his essay on Stesichorus, says that not only the
poems of Homer, but those also of Hesiod and Archilochus, and also of
Mimnermus and Phocylides, were often recited to the accompaniment of
music; and Clearchus, in the first book of his treatise on Pictures,
says&mdash;"Simonides of Zacynthus used to sit in the theatres on a lofty
chair reciting the verses of Archilochus." And Lysanias, in the first
book of his treatise on Iambic Poets, says that Mnasion the rhapsodist
used in his public recitations to deliver some of the Iambics of
Simonides. And Cleomenes the rhapsodist, at the Olympic games, recited
the Purification of Empedocles, as is asserted by Dicæarchus in his
history of Olympia. And Jason, in the third book of his treatise on the
Temples of Alexander, says that Hegesias, the comic actor, recited the
works of Herodotus in the great theatre, and that Hermophantus recited
the poems of Homer.</p>

<p>13. And the men called Hilarodists (whom some people at the present day
call Simodists, as Aristocles tells us in his first book on Choruses,
because Simus the Magnesian was the most celebrated of all the poets of
joyous songs,) frequently come under our notice. And Aristocles also
gives a regular list of them in his treatise on Music, where he speaks
in the following manner:&mdash;"The Magodist&mdash;but he is the same as the
Lysiodist." But Aristoxenus says that Magodus is the name given to an
actor who acts both male and female characters;<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
but that he who acts a woman's part in combination with a man's is
called a Lysiodist. And they both sing the same songs, and in other
respects they are similar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 990]</span></p>

<p>The Ionic dialect also supplies us with poems of Sotades, and with what
before his time were called Ionic poems, such as those of Alexander
the Ætolian, and Pyres the Milesian, and Alexas, and other poets
of the same kind; and Sotades is called κιναιδόλογος. And
Sotades the Maronite was very notorious for this kind of poetry, as
Carystius of Pergamus says in his essay on Sotades; and so was the son
of Sotades, Apollonius: and this latter also wrote an essay on his
father's poetry, from which one may easily see the unbridled licence of
language which Sotades allowed himself,&mdash;abusing Lysimachus the king
in Alexandria,&mdash;and, when at the court of Lysimachus, abusing Ptolemy
Philadelphus,&mdash;and in different cities speaking ill of different
sovereigns; on which account, at last, he met with the punishment that
he deserved: for when he had sailed from Alexandria (as Hegesander,
in his Reminiscences, relates), and thought that he had escaped all
danger, (for he had said many bitter things against Ptolemy the king,
and especially this, after he had heard that he had married his sister
Arsinoe,&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse">He pierced forbidden fruit with deadly sting,)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Patrocles, the general of Ptolemy, caught him in the island of Caunus,
and shut him up in a leaden vessel, and carried him into the open sea
and drowned him. And his poetry is of this kind: Philenus was the
father of Theodorus the flute-player, on whom he wrote these lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">And he, opening the door which leads from the back-street,</div>
    <div class="verse">Sent forth vain thunder from a leafy cave,</div>
    <div class="verse">Such as a mighty ploughing ox might utter.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>


<div class="sidenote-left">MAGODI.</div>

<p>14. But the Hilarodus, as he is called, is a more respectable kind
of poet than these men are; for he is never effeminate or indecorous,
but he wears a white manly robe, and he is crowned with a golden crown:
and in former times he used to wear sandals, as Aristocles tells us;
but at the present day he wears only slippers. And some man or woman
sings an accompaniment to him, as to a person who sings to the flute.
And a crown is given to a Hilarodus, as well as to a person who sings
to the flute; but such honours are not allowed to a player on the harp
or on the flute. But the man who is called a Magodus has drums and
cymbals, and wears all kinds

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 991]</span>

of woman's attire; and he behaves in an effeminate manner, and does
every sort of indecorous, indecent thing,&mdash;imitating at one time a
woman, at another an adulterer or a pimp: or sometimes he represents a
drunken man, or even a serenade offered by a reveller to his mistress.
And Aristoxenus says that the business of singing joyous songs is a
respectable one, and somewhat akin to tragedy; but that the business
of a Magodus is more like comedy. And very often it happens that the
Magodi, taking the argument of some comedy, represent it according to
their own fashion and manner. And the word μαγῳδία was derived
from the fact that those who addicted themselves to the practice,
uttered things like magical incantations, and often declared the power
of various drugs.</p>

<p>15. But there was among the Lacedæmonians an ancient kind of comic
diversion, as Sosibius says, not very important or serious, since
Sparta aimed at plainness even in pastimes. And the way was, that some
one, using very plain, unadorned language, imitated persons stealing
fruit, or else some foreign physician speaking in this way, as Alexis,
in his Woman who has taken Mandragora, represents one: and he says&mdash;</p>

<p>And those who practised this kind of sport were called among the
Lacedæmonians δικηλισταὶ, which is a term equivalent to
σκευοποιοὶ or μιμηταί.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
There are, however, many names, varying in different places, for
this class of δικηλισταί;
for the Sicyonians call them φαλλοφόροι, and others call them αὐτοκάβδαλοι, and some call them φλύακες, as the Italians do; but people in general
call them Sophists: and the Thebans, who are very much in the habit
of giving peculiar names to many things, call them ἐθελονταί. But that the Thebans do introduce all
kinds of innovations with respect to words, Strattis shows us in the
Phœnissæ, where he says&mdash;</p>

called αὑτοκάβδαλοι used to wear crowns of ivy, and they
would go through long poems slowly. But at a later time both they and
their poems were called Iambics. And those," he proceeds, "who are
called Ithyphalli, wear a mask representing the face of a drunken man,
and wear crowns, having gloves embroidered with flowers. And they
wear tunics shot with white; and they wear a Tarentine robe, which
covers them down to their ancles: and they enter at the stage entrance
silently, and when they have reached the middle of the orchestra, they
turn towards the spectators, and say&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">MUSIC.</div>

<p>for, my dear fellows, "Music," as the Harp-player of Theophilus says,
"is a great and lasting treasure to all who have learnt it and know
anything about it;" for it ameliorates the disposition, and softens
those who are passionate and quarrelsome in their tempers. Accordingly,
"Clinias the Pythagorean," as Chamæleon of Pontus relates, "who was a
most unimpeachable man

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 995]</span>

both in his actual conduct and also in his disposition, if ever it
happened to him to get out of temper or indignant at anything, would
take up his lyre, and play upon it. And when people asked him the
reason of this conduct, he used to say, 'I am pacifying myself.' And
so, too, the Achilles of Homer was mollified by the music of the harp,
which is all that Homer allots to him out of the spoils of
Eetion,<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
as being able to check his fiery temper. And he is the only hero in the
whole Iliad who indulges in this music."</p>

<p>Now, that music can heal diseases, Theophrastus asserts in his treatise
on Enthusiasm, where he says that men with diseases in the loins
become free from pain if any one plays a Phrygian air opposite to the
part affected. And the Phrygians are the first people who invented
and employed the harmony which goes by their name; owing to which
circumstance it is that the flute-players among the Greeks have usually
Phrygian and servile-sounding names, such as Sambas in Alcman, and
Adon, and Telus. And in Hipponax we find Cion, and Codalus, and Babys,
from whom the proverb arose about men who play worse and worse,&mdash;"He
plays worse than Babys." But Aristoxenus ascribes the invention of this
harmony to Hyagnis the Phrygian.</p>

<p>19. But Heraclides of Pontus, in the third book of his treatise on
Music, says&mdash;"Now that harmony ought not to be called Phrygian, just
as it has no right either to be called Lydian. For there are three
harmonies; as there are also three different races of Greeks&mdash;Dorians,
Æolians, and Ionians: and accordingly there is no little difference
between their manners. The Lacedæmonians are of all the Dorians the
most strict in maintaining their national customs; and the Thessalians

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 996]</span>

(and these are they who were the origin of the
Æolian race) have preserved at all times very nearly the same customs
and institutions; but the population of the Ionians has been a great
deal changed, and has gone through many transitions, because they have
at all times resembled whatever nations of barbarians have from time
to time been their masters. Accordingly, that species of melody which
the Dorians composed they called the Dorian harmony, and that which the
Æolians used to sing they named the Æolian harmony, and the third they
called the Ionian, because they heard the Ionians sing it.</p>

<p>"Now the Dorian harmony is a manly and high-sounding strain, having
nothing relaxed or merry in it, but, rather, it is stern and vehement,
not admitting any great variations or any sudden changes. The character
of the Æolian harmony is pompous and inflated, and full of a sort of
pride; and these characteristics are very much in keeping with the
fondness for breeding horses and for entertaining strangers which the
people itself exhibits. There is nothing mean in it, but the style
is elevated and fearless; and therefore we see that a fondness for
banquets and for amorous indulgences is common to the whole nation, and
they indulge in every sort of relaxation: on which account they cherish
the style of the Sub-Dorian harmony; for that which they call the
Æolian is, says Heraclides, a sort of modification of the Dorian, and
is called ὑποδώριος. And we may collect the character of this
Æolian harmony also from what Lasus of Hermione says in his hymn to the
Ceres in Hermione, where he speaks as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
   <div class="verse">I sing the praise of Ceres and of Proserpine,</div>
   <div class="verse">The sacred wife of Clymenus, Melibœa;</div>
   <div class="verse">Raising the heavy-sounding harmony</div>
   <div class="verse">Of hymns Æolian.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>But these Sub-Dorian songs, as they are called, are sung by nearly
everybody. Since, then, there is a Sub-Dorian melody, it is with great
propriety that Lasus speaks of Æolian harmony. Pratinas, too, somewhere
or other says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
   <div class="verse">Aim not at too sustain'd a style, nor yet</div>
   <div class="verse">At the relax'd Ionian harmony;</div>
   <div class="verse">But draw a middle furrow through your ground,</div>
   <div class="verse">And follow the Æolian muse in preference.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And in what comes afterwards he speaks more plainly&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
   <div class="verse">But to all men who wish to raise their voices,</div>
   <div class="verse">The Æolian harmony's most suitable.</div>

<div class="sidenote-left">MUSIC.</div>

<p>"Now formerly, as I have said, they used to call this the Æolian
harmony, but afterwards they gave it the name of the Sub-Dorian,
thinking, as some people say, that it was pitched lower on the flute
than the Dorian. But it appears to me that those who gave it this name,
seeing its inflated style, and the pretence to valour and virtue which
was put forth in the style of the harmony, thought it not exactly the
Dorian harmony, but to a certain extent like it: on which account they
called it ὑποδώριον, just as they call what is nearly white
ὑπόλευκον: and what is not absolutely sweet, but something
near it, we call ὑπόγλυκυ; so, too, we call what is not
thoroughly Dorian ὑπόδωριον.</p>

<p>20. "Next in order let us consider the character of the Milesians,
which the Ionians display, being very proud of the goodly appearance
of their persons; and full of spirit, hard to be reconciled to
their enemies, quarrelsome, displaying no philanthropic or cheerful
qualities, but rather a want of affection and friendship, and a great
moroseness of disposition: on which account the Ionian style of harmony
also is not flowery nor mirthful, but austere and harsh, and having a
sort of gravity in it, which, however, is not ignoble-looking; on which
account that tragedy has a sort of affection for that harmony. But the
manners of the Ionians of the present day are more luxurious, and the
character of their present music is very far removed from the Ionian
harmony we have been speaking of. And men say that Pythermus the Teian
wrote songs such as are called Scolia in this kind of harmony; and that
it was because he was an Ionian poet that the harmony got the name of
Ionian. This is that Pythermus whom Ananius or Hipponax mentions in his
Iambics in this way:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Pythermus speaks of gold as though all else were nought.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And Pythermus's own words are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">All other things but gold are good for nothing.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Therefore, according to this statement, it is probable that Pythermus,
as coming from those parts, adapted the character of his melodies
to the disposition of the Ionians; on which account I suppose that
his was not actually the Ionian harmony, but that it was a harmony
adapted in some admirable manner to the purpose required. And those are

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 998]</span>

contemptible people who are unable to distinguish the characteristic
differences of these separate harmonies; but who are led away by the
sharpness or flatness of the sounds, so as to describe one harmony as
ὑμερμιξολύδιος, and then again to give a definition of some
further sort, refining on this: for I do not think that even that which
is called the ὑπερφρύγιος has a distinct character of its
own, although some people do say that they have invented a new harmony
which they call Sub-Phrygian (ὑποφρύγιος). Now every kind of
harmony ought to have some distinct species of character or of passion;
as the Locrian has, for this was a harmony used by some of those who
lived in the time of Simonides and Pindar, but subsequently it fell
into contempt.</p>

<p>21. "There are, then, as we have already said, three kinds of harmony,
as there are three nations of the Greek people. But the Phrygian and
Lydian harmonies, being barbaric, became known to the Greeks by means
of the Phrygians and Lydians who came over to Peloponnesus with Pelops.
For many Lydians accompanied and followed him, because Sipylus was a
town of Lydia; and many Phrygians did so too, not because they border
on the Lydians, but because their king also was Tantalus&mdash;(and you may
see all over Peloponnesus, and most especially in Lacedæmon, great
mounds, which the people there call the tombs of the Phrygians who came
over with Pelops)&mdash;and from them the Greeks learnt these harmonies: on
which account Telestes of Selinus says&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse">First of all, Greeks, the comrades brave of Pelops,</div>

    <div class="verse">Gave forth a Lydian hymn."</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote-left">MUSIC.</div>

<p>22. "But we must not admit," says Polybius of Megalopolis, "that
music, as Ephorus asserts, was introduced among men for the purposes
of fraud and trickery. Nor must we think that the ancient Cretans and
Lacedæmonians used flutes and songs at random to excite their military
ardour, instead of trumpets. Nor are we to imagine that the earliest
Arcadians had no reason whatever for doing so, when they introduced
music into every department of their management of the republic; so
that, though the nation in every other respect was most austere in its
manner of life, they nevertheless

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 999]</span>

compelled music to be the constant companion, not only of their boys,
but even of their youths up to thirty years of age. For the Arcadians
are the only people among whom the boys are trained from infancy to
sing hymns and pæans to regular airs, in which indeed every city
celebrates their national heroes and gods with such songs, in obedience
to ancient custom.</p>

<p>"But after this, learning the airs of Timotheus and Philoxenus, they
every year, at the festival of Bacchus, dance in their theatres to
the music of flute-players; the boys dancing in the choruses of boys,
and the youths in those of men. And throughout the whole duration of
their lives they are addicted to music at their common entertainments;
not so much, however, employing musicians as singing in turn: and to
admit themselves ignorant of any other accomplishment is not at all
reckoned discreditable to them; but to refuse to sing is accounted a
most disgraceful thing. And they, practising marches so as to march
in order to the sound of the flute, and studying their dances also,
exhibit every year in the theatres, under public regulations and at the
public expense. These, then, are the customs which they have derived
from the ancients, not for the sake of luxury and superfluity, but
from a consideration of the austerity which each individual practised
in his private life, and of the severity of their characters, which
they contract from the cold and gloomy nature of the climate which
prevails in the greater part of their country. And it is the nature of
all men to be in some degree influenced by the climate, so as to get
some resemblance to it themselves; and it is owing to this that we find
different races of men, varying in character and figure and complexion,
in proportion as they are more or less distant from one another.</p>

<p>"In addition to this, they instituted public banquets and public
sacrifices, in which the men and women join; and also dances of the
maidens and boys together; endeavouring to mollify and civilize the
harshness of their natural character by the influence of education and
habit. And as the people of Cynætha neglected this system (although
they occupy by far the most inclement district of Arcadia, both as
respects the soil and the climate), they, never meeting one another
except for the purpose of giving offence and quarrelling, became at

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1000]</span>

last so utterly savage, that the very greatest impieties prevailed
among them alone of all the people of Arcadia; and at the time when
they made the great massacre, whatever Arcadian cities their emissaries
came to in their passage, the citizens of all the other cities at once
ordered them to depart by public proclamation; and the Mantineans even
made a public purification of their city after their departure, leading
victims all round their entire district."</p>

<p>23. Agias, the musician, said that "the styrax, which at the Dionysiac
festivals is burnt in the orchestras, presented a Phrygian odour
to those who were within reach of it." Now, formerly music was an
exhortation to courage; and accordingly Alcæus the poet, one of the
greatest musicians that ever lived, places valour and manliness before
skill in music and poetry, being himself a man warlike even beyond what
was necessary. On which account, in such verses as these, he speaks in
high-toned language, and says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse indent2">My lofty house is bright with brass,</div>

<p>although it would have been more suitable for him to have had his house
well stored with musical instruments. But the ancients considered manly
courage the greatest of all civil virtues, and they attributed the
greatest importance to that, to the exclusion of other good qualities.
Archilochus accordingly, who was a distinguished poet, boasted in the
first place of being able to partake in all political undertakings,
and in the second place he mentioned the credit he had gained by his
poetical efforts, saying,&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse">Skill'd also in the Muses' lovely art.</div>

  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And, in the same spirit, Æschylus, though a man who had
acquired such great renown by his poetry, nevertheless preferred having
his valour recorded on his tomb, and composed an inscription for it, of
which the following lines are a part:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">The grove of Marathon, and the long-hair'd Medes,</div>
    <div class="verse">Who felt his courage, well may speak of it.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>24. And it is on this account that the Lacedæmonians, who are a most
valiant nation, go to war to the music of the flute, and the Cretans
to the strains of the lyre, and the Lydians to the sound of pipes and
flutes, as Herodotus relates. And, moreover, many of the barbarians
make all their public proclamations to the accompaniment of flutes
and harps, softening the souls of their enemies by these means. And
Theopompus, in the forty-sixth book of his History, says&mdash;"The Getæ
make all their proclamations while holding harps in their hands and
playing on them." And it is perhaps on this account that Homer, having
due regard to the ancient institutions and customs of the Greeks, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">I hear, what graces every feast, the lyre;<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>as if this art of music were welcome also to men feasting.</p>

<p>Now it was, as it should seem, a regular custom to introduce music,
in the first place in order that every one who might be too eager
for drunkenness or gluttony might have music as a sort of physician
and healer of his insolence and indecorum, and also because music
softens moroseness of temper; for it dissipates sadness, and produces
affability and a sort of gentlemanlike joy. From which consideration,
Homer has also, in the first book of the Iliad, represented the gods
as using music after their dissensions on the subject of Achilles; for
they continued for some time listening to it&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Thus the blest gods the genial day prolong</div>

   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>For it was desirable that they should leave off their quarrels
and dissensions, as we have said. And most people seem to attribute
the practice of this art to banquets for the sake of setting things
right, and of the general mutual advantage. And, besides these other
occasions, the ancients also established by customs and laws that at
feasts all men should sing hymns to the gods, in order by these means
to preserve

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1002]</span>

order and decency among us; for as all songs proceed according to
harmony, the consideration of the gods being added to this harmony,
elevates the feelings of each individual. And Philochorus says that the
ancients, when making their libations, did not always use dithyrambic
hymns, but "when they pour libations, they celebrate Bacchus with
wine and drunkenness, but Apollo with tranquillity and good order."
Accordingly Archilochus says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">I, all excited in my mind with wine,</div>
    <div class="verse">Am skilful in the dithyrambic, knowing</div>
    <div class="verse">The noble melodies of the sovereign Bacchus.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And Epicharmus, in his Philoctetes, says&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse">A water-drinker knows no dithyrambics.</div>

<p>So, that it was not merely with a view to superficial and vulgar
pleasure, as some assert, that music was originally introduced into
entertainments, is plain from what has been said above. But the
Lacedæmonians do not assert that they used to learn music as a science,
but they do profess to be able to judge well of what is done in the
art; and they say that they have already three times preserved it when
it was in danger of being lost.</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">DANCING.</div>

<p>25. Music also contributes to the proper exercising of the body and
to sharpening the intellect; on which account, every Grecian people,
and every barbarian nation too, that we are acquainted with, practise
it. And it was a good saying of Damon the Athenian, that songs and
dances must inevitably exist where the mind was excited in any
manner; and liberal, and gentlemanly, and honourable feelings of the
mind produce corresponding kinds of music, and the opposite feelings
likewise produce the opposite kinds of music. On which account, that
saying of Clisthenes the tyrant of Sicyon was a witty one, and a sign
of a well-educated intellect. For when he saw, as it is related,<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
one of the suitors for his daughter dancing in an unseemly manner
(it was Hippoclides the Athenian), he told him that he had danced
away his marriage, thinking, as it should seem, that the mind of the
man corresponded to the dance which he had exhibited; for in dancing
and walking decorum and good order are honourable, and disorder and
vulgarity are discreditable. And it is on this principle that the
poets originally arranged dances for

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1003]</span>

freeborn men, and employed figures only to be emblems of what was being
sung, always preserving the principles of nobleness and manliness
in them; on which account it was that they gave them the name of
ὑπορχήματα (accompaniment to the dance). And if any one, while dancing,
indulged in unseemly postures or figures, and did nothing at all
corresponding to the songs sung, he was considered blameworthy; on
which account, Aristophanes or Plato, in his Preparations (as Chamæleon
quotes the play), spoke thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">So that if any one danced well, the sight</div>
    <div class="verse">Was pleasing; but they now do nothing rightly,</div>
    <div class="verse">But stand as if amazed, and roar at random.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>For the kind of dancing which was at that time used in the choruses was
decorous and magnificent, and to a certain extent imitated the motions
of men under arms; on which account Socrates in his Poems says that
those men who dance best are the best in warlike exploits; and thus he
writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">But they who in the dance most suitably</div>
    <div class="verse">Do honour to the Gods, are likewise best</div>
    <div class="verse">In all the deeds of war.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>For the dance is very nearly an armed exercise, and is a display not
only of good discipline in other respects, but also of the care which
the dancers bestow on their persons.</p>

<p>26. And Amphion the Thespiæan, in the second book of his treatise on
the Temple of the Muses on Mount Helicon, says that in Helicon there
are dances of boys, got up with great care, quoting this ancient
epigram:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">I both did dance, and taught the citizens</div>
    <div class="verse">The art of music, and my flute-player</div>
    <div class="verse">Was Anacus the Phialensian;</div>
    <div class="verse">My name was Bacchides of Sicyon;</div>
    <div class="verse">And this my duty to the gods perform'd</div>
    <div class="verse">Was honourable to my country Sicyon.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And it was a good answer which was made by Caphesias the flute-player,
when one of his pupils began to play on the flute very loudly, and was
endeavouring to play as loudly as he could; on which he struck him,
and said, "Goodness does not consist in greatness, but greatness in
goodness." There are also relics and traces of the ancient dancing in
some statues which we have, which were made by ancient statuaries;
on which account men at that time paid more attention to moving

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1004]</span>

their hands with graceful gestures; for in this particular also

they aimed at graceful and gentlemanlike motions, comprehending what
was great in what was well done. And from these motions of the hands
they transferred some figures to the dances, and from the dances to
the palæstra; for they sought to improve their manliness by music
and by paying attention to their persons. And they practised to the
accompaniment of song with reference to their movements when under
arms; and it was from this practice that the dance called the
Pyrrhic dance originated, and every other dance of this kind,
and all the others which have the same name or any similar one
with a slight change: such as the Cretan dances called ὀρσίτης and ἐπικρήδιος; and that dance, too, which is named
ἀπόκινος, (and it is mentioned under this name by Cratinus in
his Nemesis, and by Cephisodorus in his Amazons, and by Aristophanes in
his Centaur, and by several other poets,) though afterwards it came to
be called μακτρισμός; and many women used to dance it, who, I
am aware, were afterwards called μαρκτύπιαι.</p>

<p>27. But the more sedate kinds of dance, both the more varied kinds
and those too whose figures are more simple, are the following:&mdash;The
Dactylus, the Iambic, the Molossian, the Emmelea, the Cordax, the
Sicinnis, the Persian, the Phrygian, the Nibatismus, the Thracian, the
Calabrismus, the Telesias (and this is a Macedonian dance which Ptolemy
was practising when he slew Alexander the brother of Philip, as Marsyas
relates in the third book of his History of Macedon). The following
dances are of a frantic kind:&mdash;The Cernophorus, and the Mongas, and
the Thermaustris. There was also a kind of dance in use among private
individuals, called the ἄνθεμα, and they used to dance this
while repeating the following form of words with a sort of mimicking
gesture, saying&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse indent2">And is this my beautiful parsley?</div>
   </div>

</div>

<div class="sidenote-left">DANCES.</div>

<p>Among the Syracusans there was a kind of dance called the Chitoneas,
sacred to Diana, and it is a peculiar kind of dance, accompanied with
the flute. There was also an Ionian kind of dance practised at drinking
parties. They also practised the dance called ἀγγελικὴ at their drinking parties. And there is
another kind of dance called the Burning of the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1005]</span>

World, which Menippus the Cynic mentions in his Banquet.
There are also some dances of a ridiculous character:&mdash;the Igdis,
the Mactrismus, the Apocinus, and the Sobas; and besides these, the
Morphasmus, and the Owl, and the Lion, and the Pouring out of Meal, and
the Abolition of Debts, and the Elements, and the Pyrrhic dance. And
they also danced to the accompaniment of the flute a dance which they
called the Dance of the Master of the Ship, and the Platter Dance.</p>

<p>The figures used in dances are the Xiphismus, the Calathismus, the
Callabides, the Scops, and the Scopeuma. And the Scops was a figure
intended to represent people looking out from a distance, making an
arch over their brows with their hand so as to shade their eyes. And it
is mentioned by Æschylus in his Spectators:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">And all these old σκωπεύματα of yours.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And Eupolis, in his Flatterers, mentions the Callabides, when he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">He walks as though he were dancing the Callabides.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Other figures are the Thermastris, the Hecaterides,<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
the Scopus, the Hand-down, the Hand-up, the Dipodismus, the Taking-hold
of Wood, the Epanconismus, the Calathiscus, the Strobilus. There
is also a dance called the Telesias; and this is a martial kind of
dance, deriving its title from a man of the name of Telesias, who
was the first person who ever danced it, holding arms in his hands,
as Hippagoras tells us in the first book of his treatise on the
Constitution of the Carthaginians.</p>

<p>28. There is also a kind of satyric dance called the Sicinnis, as
Aristocles says in the eighth book of his treatise on Dances; and
the Satyrs are called Sicinnistæ. But some say that a barbarian of
the name of Sicinnus was the inventor of it, though others say that
Sicinnus was a Cretan by birth; and certainly the Cretans are dancers,
as is mentioned by Aristoxenus. But Scamon, in the first book of his
treatise on Inventions, says that this dance is called Sicinnis, from
being shaken (ἀπὸ τοῦ σείεσθαι), and that Thersippus was the
first person who danced the Sicinnis. Now in dancing, the motion of the
feet was adopted long before any motion of the hands was considered
requisite; for the ancients exercised their feet more than their hands
in games and in hunting; and the Cretans are

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1006]</span>

greatly addicted to hunting, owing to which they are swift of foot. But
there are people to be found who assert that Sicinnis is a word formed
poetically from κινησις,<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
because in dancing it the Satyrs use most rapid movements; for this
kind of dance gives no scope for a display of the passions, on which
account also it is never slow.</p>

<p>Now all satyric poetry formerly consisted of choruses, as also did
tragedy, such as it existed at the same time; and that was the chief
reason why tragedy had no regular actors. And there are three kinds
of dance appropriate to dramatic poetry,&mdash;the tragic, the comic,
and the satyric; and in like manner, there are three kinds of lyric
dancing,&mdash;the pyrrhic, the gymnopædic, and the hyporchematic. And the
pyrrhic dance resembles the satyric; for they both consist of rapid
movements; but the pyrrhic appears to be a warlike kind of dance, for
it is danced by armed boys. And men in war have need of swiftness to
pursue their enemies, and also, when defeated,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">To flee, and not like madmen to stand firm,</div>
    <div class="verse">Nor be afraid to seem a short time cowards.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>But the dance called Gymnopædica is like the dance in tragedy which
is called Emmelea; for in each there is seen a degree of gravity and
solemnity. But the hyporchematic dance is very nearly identical with
the comic one which is called Cordax. And they are both a sportive kind
of figure.</p>

<p>29. But Aristoxenus says that the Pyrrhic dance derives its name from
Pyrrhichus, who was a Lacedæmonian by birth; and that even to this day
Pyrrhichus is a Lacedæmonian name. And the dance itself, being of a
warlike character, shows that it is the invention of some Lacedæmonian;
for the Lacedæmonians are a martial race, and their sons learn military
marches which they call ἐνόπλια. And the Lacedæmonians
themselves in their wars recite the poems of Tyrtæus, and move in time
to those airs. But Philochorus asserts that the Lacedæmonians, when
owing to the generalship of Tyrtæus they had subdued the Messenians,
introduced a regular custom, in their expeditions, that whenever they
were at supper, and had sung the pæan, they should also sing one of
Tyrtæus's hymns as a solo, one after another; and that the polemarch
should be the judge, and should give a piece of meat as a prize to him
who sang best. But the Pyrrhic dance is not

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1007]</span>

preserved now among any other people of Greece; and since that has
fallen into disuse, their wars also have been brought to a conclusion;
but it continues in use among the Lacedæmonians alone, being a sort of
prelude preparatory to war: and all who are more than five years old in
Sparta learn to dance the Pyrrhic dance.</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">DANCES.</div>

<p>But the Pyrrhic dance as it exists in our time, appears to be a sort
of Bacchic dance, and a little more pacific than the old one; for the
dancers carry thyrsi instead of spears, and they point and dart canes
at one another, and carry torches. And they dance in figures having
reference to Bacchus, and to the Indians, and to the story of Pentheus:
and they require for the Pyrrhic dance the most beautiful airs, and
what are called the "stirring" tunes.</p>

<p>30. But the Gymnopædica resembles the dance which by the ancients
used to be called Anapale; for all the boys dance naked, performing
some kind of movement in regular time, and with gestures of the hand
like those used by wrestlers: so that the dancers exhibit a sort of
spectacle akin to the palæstra and to the pancratium, moving their feet
in regular time. And the different modes of dancing it are called the
Oschophoricus,<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
and the Bacchic, so that this kind of dance, too, has some reference
to Bacchus. But Aristoxenus says that the ancients, after they had
exercised themselves in the Gymnopædica, turned to the Pyrrhic dance
before they entered the theatre: and the Pyrrhic dance is also called
the Cheironomia. But the Hyporchematic dance is that in which the
chorus dances while singing. Accordingly Bacchylides says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">There's no room now for sitting down,</div>
    <div class="verse">There's no room for delay.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And Pindar says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">The Lacedæmonian troop of maidens fair.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And the Lacedæmonians dance this dance in Pindar. And the
Hyporchematica is a dance of men and women. Now the best modes are
those which combine dancing with the singing; and they are these&mdash;the
Prosodiacal, the Apostolical (which last is also called παρθένιος), and others of the same kind. And some danced to the
hymn and some did not; and some danced in accompaniment to hymns to
Venus and Bacchus, and to the Pæan, dancing at one time and resting at
another. And

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1008]</span>

among the barbarians as well as among the Greeks there are respectable
dances and also indecorous ones. Now the Cordax among the Greeks is an
indecorous dance, but the Emmelea is a respectable one: as is among the
Arcadians the Cidaris, and among the Sicyonians the Aleter; and it is
called Aleter also in Ithaca, as Aristoxenus relates in the first book
of his History of Sicyon. And this appears enough to say at present on
the subject of dances.</p>

<p>31. Now formerly decorum was carefully attended to in music, and
everything in this art had its suitable and appropriate ornament: on
which account there were separate flutes for each separate kind of
harmony; and every flute-player had flutes adapted to each kind of
harmony in their contests. But Pronomus the Theban was the first man
who played the three different kinds of harmony already mentioned
on the same flute. But now people meddle with music in a random and
inconsiderate manner. And formerly, to be popular with the vulgar was
reckoned a certain sign of a want of real skill: on which account
Asopodorus the Phliasian, when some flute-player was once being much
applauded while he himself was remaining in the hyposcenium,<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
said&mdash;"What is all this? the man has evidently committed some great
blunder:"&mdash;as else he could not possibly have been so much approved
of by the mob. But I am aware that some people tell this story as if
it were Antigenides who said this. But in our days artists make the
objects of their art to be the gaining the applause of the spectators
in the theatre; on which account Aristoxenus, in his book entitled
Promiscuous Banquets, says&mdash;"We act in a manner similar to the people
of Pæstum who dwell in the Tyrrhenian Gulf; for it happened to them,
though they were originally Greeks, to have become at last completely
barbarised, becoming Tyrrhenians or Romans, and to have changed their
language, and all the rest of their national habits. But one Greek
festival they do celebrate even to the present day, in which they meet
and recollect all their ancient names and customs, and bewail their
loss to one another, and then, when they have wept for them, they
go home. And so," says he, "we also, since the theatres have become
completely barbarised, and since music has become entirely ruined and
vulgar, we, being but a few, will recall to

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1009]</span>

our minds, sitting by ourselves, what music once was." And this was the
discourse of Aristoxenus.</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">MUSIC.</div>

<p>32. Wherefore it seems to me that we ought to have a philosophical
conversation about music: for Pythagoras the Samian, who had such
a high reputation as a philosopher, is well known, from many
circumstances, to have been a man who had no slight or superficial
knowledge of music; for he indeed lays it down that the whole universe
is put and kept together by music. And altogether the ancient
philosophy of the Greeks appears to have been very much addicted to
music; and on this account they judged Apollo to have been the most
musical and the wisest of the gods, and Orpheus of the demi-gods. And
they called every one who devoted himself to the study of this art a
sophist, as Æschylus does in the verse where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">And then the sophist sweetly struck the lyre.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And that the ancients were excessively devoted to the study of music is
plain from Homer, who, because all his own poetry was adapted to music,
makes, from want of care, so many verses which are headless, and weak,
and imperfect in the tail. But Xenophanes, and Solon, and Theognis, and
Phocylides, and besides them Periander of Corinth, an elegiac poet,
and the rest of those who did not set melodies to their poems, compose
their verses with reference to number and to the arrangement of the
metres, and take great care that none of their verses shall be liable
to the charge of any of the irregularities which we just now imputed to
Homer. Now when we call a verse headless (ἀκέφαλος), we mean
such as have a mutilation or lameness at the beginning, such as&mdash;</p>

<p>33. But of all the Greeks, the Lacedæmonians were those who preserved
the art of music most strictly, as they applied themselves to the
practice a great deal: and there were a great many lyric poets among
them. And even to this day they preserve their ancient songs carefully,
being possessed of very varied and very accurate learning on the
subject; on which account Pratinas says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">The Lacedæmonian grasshopper sweetly sings,</div>
    <div class="verse">Well suited to the chorus.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And on this account the poets also continually styled their odes&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">President of sweetest hymns:</div>

   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">The honey-wing'd melodies of the Muse.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>For owing to the general moderation and austerity of their lives,
they betook themselves gladly to music, which has a sort of power of
soothing the understanding; so that it was natural enough that people
who hear it should be delighted. And the people whom they called
Choregi, were not, as Demetrius of Byzantium tells us in the fourth
book of his treatise on Poetry, those who have that name now, the
people, that is to say, who hire the choruses, but those who actually
led the choruses, as the name intimates: and so it happened, that the
Lacedæmonians were good musicians, and did not violate the ancient laws
of music.</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">MUSIC.</div>

<p>Now in ancient times all the Greeks were fond of music; but when in
subsequent ages disorders arose, when nearly all the ancient customs
had got out of fashion and had become obsolete, this fondness for music
also wore out, and bad styles of music were introduced, which led all
the composers to aim at effeminacy rather than delicacy, and at an
enervated and dissolute rather than a modest style. And

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1011]</span>

perhaps this will still exist hereafter in a greater degree, and
will extend still further, unless some one again draws forth the
national music to the light. For formerly the subjects of their songs
used to be the exploits of heroes, and the praises of the Gods; and
accordingly Homer says of Achilles&mdash;</p>

<p>And this custom was preserved among the barbarians, as Dinon tells us
in his history of Persia. Accordingly, the poets used to celebrate the
valour of the elder Cyrus, and they foresaw the war which was going to
be waged against Astyages. "For when," says he, "Cyrus had begun his
march against the Persians, (and he had previously been the commander
of the guards, and afterwards of the heavy-armed troops there, and then
he left;) and while Astyages was sitting at a banquet with his friends,
then a man, whose name was Angares, (and he was the most illustrious
of his minstrels,) being called in, sang other things, such as were
customary, and at last he said that&mdash;</p>

<p>And when Astyages asked him what monster he meant, he said&mdash;'Cyrus

<p>After this there arose a discussion about the sambuca. And Masurius
said that the sambuca was a musical instrument, very shrill, and that
it was mentioned by Euphorion (who is also an Epic poet), in his book
on the Isthmian Games; for he says that it was used by the Parthians
and by the Troglodytæ, and that it had four strings. He said also that
it was mentioned by Pythagoras, in his treatise on the Red Sea. The
sambuca is also a name given to an engine used in sieges, the form and
mechanism of which is explained by Biton, in his book addressed to
Attalus on the subject of Military Engines. And Andreas of Panormus,
in the thirty-third book of his History of Sicily, detailed city by
city, says that it is borne against the walls of the enemy on two
cranes. And it is called sambuca because when it is raised up it
gives a sort of appearance of a ship and ladder joined together, and
resembles the shape of the musical instrument of the same name. But
Moschus, in the first book of his treatise on Mechanics, says that the
sambuca is originally a Roman engine, and that Heraclides of Pontus was
the original inventor of it. But Polybius, in the eighth book of his
History, says,&mdash;"Marcellus, having been a great deal inconvenienced
at that siege of Syracuse by the contrivances of Archimedes, used to
say that Archimedes had given his ships drink out of the sea; but that
his sambucæ had been buffeted and driven from the entertainment in
disgrace."</p>

<p>35. And when, after this, Æmilianus said,&mdash;But, my good friend
Masurius, I myself, often, being a lover of music, turn my thoughts to
the instrument which is called the magadis, and cannot decide whether
I am to think that it was a species of flute or some kind of harp. For
that sweetest of poets, Anacreon, says somewhere or other&mdash;</p>

   </div>

</div>

<p>But Ion of Chios, in his Omphale, speaks of it as if it were a

<p>And Aristarchus the grammarian, (a man whom Panætius the Rhodian
philosopher used to call the Prophet, because he could so easily divine
the meanings of poems,) when explaining this verse, affirms that the
magadis was a kind of flute: though Aristoxenus does not say so either
in his treatise on the Flute-players or in that on Flutes and other
Musical Instruments; nor does Archestratus either,&mdash;and he also wrote
two books on Flute-players; nor has Pyrrhander said so in his work on
Flute-players; nor Phillis the Delian,&mdash;for he also wrote a treatise on
Flute-players, and so did Euphranor. But Tryphon, in the second book
of his essay on Names, speaks thus&mdash;"The flute called magadis." And in
another place he says&mdash;"The magadis gives a shrill and deep tone at
the same time, as Anaxandrides intimates in his Man fighting in heavy
Armour, where we find the line&mdash;</p>

  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And, my dear Masurius, there is no one else except you who can solve
this difficulty for me.</p>

<p>36. And Masurius replied&mdash;Didymus the grammarian, in his
work entitled Interpretations of the Plays of Ion different from
the Interpretations of others, says, my good friend Æmilianus, that
by the term μάγαδις αὐλὸς
he understands the instrument which is also called κιθαριστήριος; which is mentioned by Aristoxenus in the first book of
his treatise on the Boring of Flutes; for there he says that there are
five kinds of flutes; the parthenius, the pædicus, the citharisterius,
the perfect, and the superperfect. And he says that Ion has omitted
the conjunction τε improperly, so that we are to understand
by μάγαδις αὐλὸς the flute which accompanies the magadis; for
the magadis is a stringed (ψαλτικὸν) instrument, as Anacreon
tells us, and it was invented by the Lydians, on which account Ion, in
his Omphale, calls the Lydian women ψάλτριαι, as playing on
stringed instruments, in the following lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse">But come, ye Lydian ψάλτριαι, and singing</div>

   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>But Theophilus the comic poet, in his Neoptolemus, calls playing on the
magadis μαγαδίζειν, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">It may be that a worthless son may sing</div>

    <div class="verse">Shall ever play such music now as theirs.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And Euphorion, in his treatise on the Isthmian Games, says, that
the magadis is an ancient instrument, but that in latter times it was
altered, and had the name also changed to that of the sambuca. And,
that this instrument was very much used at Mitylene, so that one of the
Muses was represented by an old statuary, whose name was Lesbothemis,
as holding one in her hand. But Menæchmus, in his treatise on Artists,
says that the πηκτὶς , which he calls identical with the magadis, was
invented by Sappho. And Aristoxenus says that the magadis and the
pectis were both played with the fingers without any plectrum; on which
account Pindar, in his Scolium addressed to Hiero, having named the
magadis, calls it a responsive harping (ψαλμὸν ἀντίφθογγον), because
its music is accompanied in all its keys by two kinds of singers,
namely, men and boys. And Phrynichus, in his Phœnician Women, has
said&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">

   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Singing responsive songs on tuneful harps.</div>

<p>And Sophocles, in his Mysians, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">There sounded too the Phrygian triangle,</div>
    <div class="verse">With oft-repeated notes; to which responded</div>
    <div class="verse">The well-struck strings of the soft Lydian pectis.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>37. But some people raise a question how, as the magadis did not exist
in the time of Anacreon (for instruments with many strings were never
seen till after his time), Anacreon can possibly mention it, as he does
when he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse">I hold my magadis and sing,</div>

   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>But Posidonius asserts that Anacreon mentions three kinds of melodies,
the Phrygian, the Dorian, and the Lydian; for that these were the only
melodies with which he was acquainted. And as every one of these is
executed on seven strings, he says that it was very nearly correct
of Anacreon to speak of twenty strings, as he only omits one for the
sake of speaking in round numbers. But Posidonius is ignorant that the
magadis is an ancient instrument, though Pindar says plainly enough
that Terpander invented the barbitos to correspond to, and answer the
pectis in use among the Lydians&mdash;</p>

   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Now the pectis and the magadis are the same instrument, as Aristoxenus
tells us, and Menæchmus the Sicyonian too, in his treatise on
Artists. And this last author says that Sappho, who is more ancient
than Anacreon, was the first person to use the pectis. Now, that
Terpander is more ancient than Anacreon, is evident from the following
considerations:&mdash;Terpander was the first man who ever got the victory
at the Carnean<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
games, as Hellanicus tells us in the verses in which he has celebrated
the victors at the Carnea, and also in the formal catalogue which he
gives us of them. But the first establishment of the Carnea took place
in the twenty-sixth Olympiad, as Sosibius tells us in his essay on
Dates. But Hieronymus, in his treatise on Harp-players, which is the
subject of the fifth of his Treatises on Poets, says that Terpander
was a contemporary of Lycurgus the lawgiver, who, it is agreed by all
men, was, with Iphitus of Elis, the author of that establishment of the
Olympic games from which the first Olympiad is reckoned. But Euphorion,
in his treatise on the Isthmian Games, says that the instruments with
many strings are altered only in their names; but that the use of them
is very ancient.</p>

<p>38. However, Diogenes the tragic poet represents the pectis as
differing from the magadis; for in the Semele he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse">While flutes in Persian manner neatly join'd</div>
    <div class="verse">Accompany the chorus.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And Phillis the Delian, in the second book of his treatise on Music,
also asserts that the pectis is different from the magadis. And his
words are these&mdash;"There are the phœnices, the pectides, the magadides,
the sambucæ, the iambycæ, the triangles, the clepsiambi, the scindapsi,
the nine-string." For, he says that "the lyre to which they sang
iambics, they called the iambyca, and the instrument to which they sang
them in such a manner as to vary the metre a little, they called the
clepsiambus,<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
while the magadis was an instrument uttering a diapason sound,
and equally in tune for every portion of the singers. And besides
these there were instruments of other kinds also; for there was the
barbitos, or barmus, and many others, some with strings, and some with
sounding-boards."</p>

<p>39. There were also some instruments besides those which were blown
into, and those which were used with different strings, which gave
forth only sounds of a simple nature, such as the castanets (κρέμβαλα),
which are mentioned by Dicæarchus, in his essay on the Manners and
Customs of Greece, where he says, that formerly certain instruments
were in very frequent use, in order to accompany women while dancing
and singing; and when any one touched these instruments with their
fingers they uttered a shrill sound. And he says that this is plainly
shown in the hymn to Diana, which begins thus&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse">The well-gilt brazen-sounding castanets.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And Hermippus, in his play called The Gods, gives the word for rattling
the castanets, κρεμβαλίζειν, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS.</div>

<p>But Didymus says, that some people, instead of the lyre, are in the
habit of striking oyster-shells and cockle-shells against

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1017]</span>

one another, and by these means contrive to play a tune in time to the
dancers, as Aristophanes also intimates in his Frogs.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>40. But Artemon, in the first book of his treatise on the Dionysian
System, as he calls it, says that Timotheus the Milesian appears
to many men to have used an instrument of more strings than were
necessary, namely, the magadis, on which account he was chastised by
the Lacedæmonians as having corrupted the ancient music. And when some
one was going to cut away the superfluous strings from his lyre, he
showed them a little statue of Apollo which they had, which held in its
hand a lyre with an equal number of strings, and which was tuned in
the same manner; and so he was acquitted. But Douris, in his treatise
on Tragedy, says that the magadis was named after Magodis, who was
a Thracian by birth. But Apollodorus, in his Reply to the Letter of
Aristocles, says&mdash;"That which we now call ψαλτήριον is the
same instrument which was formerly called magadis; but that which used
to be called the clepsiambus, and the triangle, and the elymus, and the
nine-string, have fallen into comparative disuse." And Alcman says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">And put away the magadis.</div>

<p>And Sophocles, in his Thamyras, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">And well-compacted lyres and magadides,</div>

    <div class="verse">From which the Greeks do wake the sweetest sounds.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>But Telestes, in his dithyrambic poem, called Hymenæus, says that
the magadis was an instrument with five strings, using the following
expressions&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">And each a different strain awakens,&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse">One struck the loud horn-sounding magadis,</div>
    <div class="verse">And in the fivefold number of tight strings</div>
    <div class="verse">Moved his hand to and fro most rapidly.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>I am acquainted, too, with another instrument which the Thracian kings
use in their banquets, as Nicomedes tells us in his essay on Orpheus.
Now Ephorus and Scamon, in their treatise on Inventions, say that the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1018]</span>

instrument called the Phœnix derives its name from having been
invented by the Phœnicians. But Semus of Delos, in the first book of
the Delias, says that it is so called because its ribs are made of the
palm-tree which grows in Delos. The same writer, Semus, says that the
first person who used the sambuca was Sibylla, and that the instrument
derives its name from having been invented by a man named Sambyx.</p>

<p>41. And concerning the instrument called the tripod (this also is a
musical instrument) the before-mentioned Artemo writes as follows&mdash;"And
that is how it is that there are many instruments, as to which it is
even uncertain whether they ever existed; as, for instance, the tripod
of Pythagoras of Zacynthus. For as it was in fashion but a very short
time, and as, either because the fingering of it appeared exceedingly
difficult, or for some other reason, it was very soon disused, it has
escaped the notice of most writers altogether. But the instrument was
in form very like the Delphian tripod, and it derived its name from
it; but it was used like a triple harp. For its feet stood on some
pedestal which admitted of being easily turned round, just as the legs
of movable chairs are made; and along the three intermediate spaces
between the feet, strings were stretched; an arm being placed above
each, and tuning-pegs, to which the strings were attached, below. And
on the top there was the usual ornament of the vase, and of some other
ornaments which were attached to it; all which gave it a very elegant
appearance; and it emitted a very powerful sound. And Pythagoras
divided the three harmonies with reference to three countries,&mdash;the
Dorian, the Lydian, and Phrygian. And he himself sitting on a chair
made on the same principles and after the same pattern, putting out his
left hand so as to take hold of the instrument, and using the plectrum
in his other hand, moved the pedestal with his foot very easily, so
as to use whichever side of the instrument he chose to begin with;
and then again turning to the other side he went on playing, and then
he changed to the third side. And so rapidly did the easy movement of
the pedestal, when touched by the foot, bring the various sides under
his hand, and so very rapid was his fingering and execution, that if
a person had not seen what was being done, but had judged only by his
ear, he would have fancied that he was listening to three harp-players

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1019]</span>

all playing on different instruments. But this instrument, though it
was so greatly admired, after his death rapidly fell into disuse."</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">MUSIC.</div>

<p>42. Now the system of playing the harp without any vocal accompaniment,
was, as Menæchmus informs us, first introduced by Aristonicus the
Argive, who was a contemporary of Archilochus, and lived in Corcyra.
But Philochorus, in the third hook of his Atthis, says&mdash;"Lysander the
Sicyonian harp-player was the first person who ever changed the art
of pure instrumental performance, dwelling on the long tones, and
producing a very rich sound, and adding also to the harp the music of
the flute; and this last addition was first introduced by Epigonus;
and taking away the jejuneness which existed in the music of those
who played the harp alone without any vocal accompaniment, he first
introduced various beautiful modifications<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
on that instrument; and he played on the different kinds of harp called
iambus and magadis, which is also called συριγμός. And he was
the first person who ever attempted to change his instrument while
playing. And afterwards, adding dignity to the business, he was the
first person to institute a chorus. And Menæchmus says that Dion of
Chius was the first person who ever played on the harp an ode such
as is used at libations to the honour of Bacchus. But Timomachus, in
his History of Cyprus, says that Stesander the Samian added further
improvements to his art, and was the first person who at Delphi sang
to his lyre the battles narrated in Homer, beginning with the Odyssey.
But others say that the first person who ever played amatory strains on
his harp was Amiton the Eleuthernæan, who did so in his own city, whose
descendants are all called Amitores.</p>

<p>But Aristoxenus says that just as some men have composed parodies on
hexameter verses, for the sake of exciting a

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1020]</span>

laugh; so, too, others have parodied the verses which
were sung to the harp, in which pastime Œnopas led the way. And he
was imitated by Polyeuctus the Achæan, and by Diocles of Cynætha.
There have also been poets who have composed a low kind of poems,
concerning whom Phænias the Eresian speaks in his writings addressed
to the Sophists; where he writes thus:&mdash;"Telenicus the Byzantian, and
also Argas, being both authors of low poems, were men who, as far as
that kind of poetry could go, were accounted clever. But they never
even attempted to rival the songs of Terpander or Phrynis." And Alexis
mentions Argas, in his Man Disembarked, thus&mdash;</p>

<p>But Teleclides, in his Rigid Men, says that he was greatly addicted to
adultery. And Clearchus, in the second book of his Amatory Anecdotes,
says that the love-songs, and those, too, which are called the Locrian
songs, do not differ in the least from the compositions of Sappho and
Anacreon. Moreover, the poems of Archilochus, and that on fieldfares,
attributed to Homer, relate to some division or other of this passion,
describing it in metrical poetry. But the writings of Asopodorus about
love, and the whole body of amorous epistles, are a sort of amatory
poetry out of metre.</p>

<p>44. When Masurius had said this, the second course, as it is called,
was served up to us; which, indeed, was very often offered to us, not
only on the days of the festival of Saturn,<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
when it is the custom of the Romans to feast their slaves, while they
themselves discharge the offices of their slaves. But this is in
reality a Grecian custom. At all events, in Crete, at the festival of
Mercury, a similar thing takes place, as Carystius tells us in his
Historic Reminiscences; for then, while the slaves are feasting, the
masters wait upon them as if they were the servants: and so they do
at Trœzen in the month Geræstius. For then there is a festival
which lasts for many days, on one of which the slaves play at dice in
common with the citizens, and the masters give a banquet to the slaves,
as Carystius himself tells us. And Berosus, in the first book of his
History of Babylon, says that on the sixteenth day of the month Lous,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1022]</span>

there is a great festival celebrated in Babylon, which is called
Sakeas; and it lasts five days: and during those days it is the custom
for the masters to be under the orders of their slaves; and one of the
slaves puts on a robe like the king's, which is called a zoganes, and
is master of the house. And Ctesias also mentions this festival in the
second book of his History of Persia. But the Coans act in an exactly
contrary manner, as Macareus tells us in the third book of his History
of Cos. For when they sacrifice to Juno, the slaves do not come to the
entertainment; on which account Phylarchus says&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse">Among the Sourii, the freemen only</div>

    <div class="verse">And no slave may come near the sacred precincts.</div>

<p>45. But Baton of Sinope, the orator, in his treatise on Thessaly and
Hæmonica, distinctly asserts that the Roman Saturnalia are originally
a very Greek festival, saying that among the Thessalians it is called
Peloria. And these are his words:&mdash;"When a common festival was being
celebrated by all the Pelasgi, a man whose name was Pelorus brought
news to Pelasgus that there had been some violent earthquakes in
Hæmonia, by which the mountains called Tempe had been rent asunder,
and that the water of the lake had burst through the rent, and was
all falling into the stream of the Peneus; and that all the country
which had formerly been covered by the lake was now laid open, and
that, as the waters were now drained off, there were plains visible
of wondrous size and beauty. Accordingly, Pelasgus, on hearing this
statement, had a table loaded with every delicacy set before Pelorus;
and every one else received him with great cordiality, and brought
whatever they had that was best, and placed it on the table before the
man who had brought this news; and Pelasgus himself waited on him with
great cheerfulness, and all the rest of the nobles obeyed him as his
servants as often as any opportunity offered. On which account, they
say that after the Pelasgi occupied the district, they instituted a
festival as a sort of imitation of the feast which took place on that
occasion; and, sacrificing to Jupiter Pelor, they serve up tables
admirably furnished, and hold a very cordial and friendly assembly,
so as to receive every foreigner at the banquet, and to set free all
the prisoners, and to make their servants sit down and feast with

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1023]</span>

every sort of liberty and licence, while their masters wait on them.
And, in short, even to this day the Thessalians celebrate this as their
chief festival, and call it Peloria."</p>

<p>And Plato, in his Atlanticus, calls these sweetmeats μεταδόρπια;
saying&mdash;"And at that time the earth used to produce all
sorts of sweet-smelling things for its inhabitants; and a great deal

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1024]</span>

of cultivated fruit, and a great variety of nuts; and all the
μεταδόρπια which give pleasure when eaten."</p>

<p>47. But Tryphon says that formerly before the guests entered the
supper-room, each person's share was placed on the table, and that
afterwards a great many dishes of various kinds were served up in
addition; and that on this account these latter dishes were called
ἐπιφορήματα. But Philyllius, in his Well-digger, speaking of
the second course, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Almonds, and nuts, and ἐπιφορήματα.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And Archippus, in his Hercules, and Herodotus, in the first book of
his History, have both used the verb ἐπιδορπίζομαι for eating
after supper. And Archippus also, in his Hercules Marrying, uses the
word ἐπιφορήματα; where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">The board was loaded with rich honey-cakes</div>
    <div class="verse">And other ἐπιφορήματα.</div>

  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And Herodotus, in the first book of his History, says&mdash;"They do not
eat a great deal of meat, but a great many ἐπιφορήματα." But
as for the proverbial saying, "The ἐπιφόρημα of Abydos,"
that is a kind of tax and harbour-due; as is explained by Aristides
in the third book of his treatise on Proverbs. But Dionysius, the
son of Tryphon, says&mdash;"Formerly, before the guests came into the
banqueting-room, the portion for each individual was placed on the
table, and afterwards a great many other things were served up in
addition (ἐπιφέρεσθαι); from which custom they were called
ἐπιφορήματα." And Philyllius, in his Well-digger, speaks of
what is brought in after the main part of the banquet is over, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Almonds, and nuts, and ἐπιτραπεζώματα.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>But Plato the comic poet, in the Menelaus, calls them ἐπιτραπέζαις, as being for eatables placed on the table (ἐμὶ ταῖς τραπέζαις), saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse indent-4"><i>A.</i><span style="margin-left: 8em;"> Come, tell me now,</span></div>

<p>And Aristotle, in his treatise on Drunkenness, says that sweetmeats
(τραγήματα) used to be called by the ancients τρωγάλια; for that they come in as a sort of second course. But it is
Pindar who said&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">And τρώγαλον is nice when supper's over,</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 1025]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">THE DIFFERENT COURSES AT DINNER.</div>

<p>And he was quite right. For Euripides says, when one looks on what is
served up before one, one may really say&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">You see how happily life passes when</div>
    <div class="verse">A man has always a well-appointed table.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>48. And that among the ancients the second course used to have a great
deal of expense and pains bestowed on it, we may learn from what Pindar
says in his Olympic Odes, where he speaks of the flesh of Pelops being
served up for food:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">And in the second course they carved</div>
    <div class="verse">Your miserable limbs, and feasted on them;</div>

   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And the ancients often called this second course simply τράπεζαι, as, for instance, Achæus in his Vulcan, which is a satyric
drama, who says,&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse indent-4"><i>A.</i><span style="margin-left: 9em;"> Surely; the dessert (τράπεζα)</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent-3">Is now being clear'd away.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>

<p>And Aristophanes, in his Wasps, says&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse">Bring water for the hands; clear the dessert.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And Aristotle, in his treatise on Drunkenness, uses the term
δεύτεραι τράπεζαι, much as we do now; saying,&mdash;"We must therefore
bear in mind that there is a difference between τράγημα and βρῶμα, as
there is also between ἒδεσμα and τρωγάλιον. For this is a national
name in use in every part of Greece, since there is food (βρῶμα) in
sweetmeats (ἐν τραγήμασι), from which consideration the man who first
used the expression δευτέρα τράπεζα, appears to
have spoken with sufficient correctness. For the eating of sweetmeats
(τραγηματισμὸς) is really an eating after supper (ἐπιδορπισμὸς); and
the sweetmeats are served up as a second supper." But Dicæarchus, in
the first book of his Descent to the Cave of Trophonius, speaks thus:
"There was also the δευτέρα τράπεζα, which was a very expensive part
of a banquet, and there were also garlands, and perfumes, and burnt
frankincense, and all the other necessary accompaniments of these
things."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 1026]</span></p>

<p>49. Eggs too often formed a part of the second course, as did hares
and thrushes, which were served up with the honey-cakes; as we find
mentioned by Antiphanes in the Leptiniscus, where he says,&mdash;</p>

<p>And as Philoxenus of Cythera, in his Banquet, where he mentions the

served up to us, we may as well cite his words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And the beautiful vessels which come in first, were brought in

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1028]</span>

again full of every kind of delicacy, which mortals call
τράπεζαι, but the Gods call them the Horn of Amalthea. And in
the middle was placed that great delight of mortals, white
marrow dressed sweet; covering its face with a thin membrane,
like a spider's web, out of modesty, that one might not
see&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.
in the dry nets of Aristæus&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;
And its name was amyllus&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;
.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;
which they call Jupiter's sweetmeats.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;. Then he distributed
plates of&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;. very
delicious&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.
and a cheesecake compounded of cheese, and milk, and
honey&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;
almonds with soft rind&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.
and nuts, which boys are very fond of; and everything else
which could be expected in plentiful and costly entertainment.
And drinking went on, and playing at the cottabus, and
conversation.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.
It was pronounced a very magnificent entertainment, and every one
admired and praised it."</p>

<p>This, then, is the description given by Philoxenus of Cythera, whom
Antiphanes praises in his Third-rate Performer, where he says&mdash;</p>

<p>51. There are many writers who have given lists of the different
kinds of cheesecakes, and as far as I can recollect, I will mention
them, and what they have said. I know, too, that Callimachus, in his
List of Various Books, mentions the treatises on the Art of Making
Cheesecakes, written by Ægimius, and Hegesippus, and Metrobius, and
also by Phætus. But I will communicate to you the names of cheesecakes
which I myself have been able to find to put down, not treating you as
Socrates was treated in the matter of the cheesecake which was sent to
him by Alcibiades; for Xanthippe took it and trampled upon it, on which
Socrates laughed, and said, "At all events you will not have any of
it yourself." (This story is related by Antipater, in the first book
of his essay on Passion.) But I, as I am fond of cheesecakes, should
have been very sorry to see that divine cheesecake so

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1029]</span>

injuriously treated. Accordingly, Plato the comic poet mentions cheesecakes in his
play called The Poet, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Am I alone to sacrifice without</div>
    <div class="verse">Having a taste allow'd me of the entrails,</div>

   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote-left">CHEESECAKES.</div>

<p>Nor do I forget that there is a village, which Demetrius the Scepsian,
in the twelfth book of his Trojan Array, tells us bears the name of
Πλακοῦς (cheesecake); and he says that it is six stadia from
Hypoplacian Thebes.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>Now, the word πλακοῦς ought to have a circumflex in the
nominative case; for it is contracted from πλακόεις, as
τυροῦς is from τυρόεις, and σησαμούς from
σησαμόεις. And it is used as a substantive, the word ἄρτος (bread) being understood.</p>

<p>Those who have lived in the place assure us that there are capital
cheesecakes to be got at Parium on the Hellespont; for it is a blunder
of Alexis, when he speaks of them as coming from the island of Paros.
And this is what he says in his play called Archilochus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>There was a kind of cheesecake called ἄμης. Antiphanes
enumerates</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">ἄμητες, ἄμυλοι;</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>and Menander, in his Supposititious Son, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">You would be glad were any one to dress</div>
    <div class="verse">A cheesecake (ἄμητα) for you.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>But the Ionians, as Seleucus tells us in his Dialects, make the
accusative case ἄμην; and they call small cheesecakes of the
same kind ἀμητίσκοι. Teleclides says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Thrushes flew of their own accord</div>
    <div class="verse">Right down my throat with savoury ἀμητίσκοι.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>53. There was also a kind called διακόνιον:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">He was so greedy that he ate a whole</div>
    <div class="verse">Diaconium up, besides an amphiphon.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>But the ἀμφιφῶν was a kind of cheesecake consecrated to
Diana, having figures of lighted torches round it. Philemon, in his
Beggar, or Woman of Rhodes, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Diana, mistress dear, I bring you now</div>
    <div class="verse">This amphiphon, and these libations holy.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Diphilus also mentions it in his Hecate. Philochorus also mentions the
fact of its being called ἀμφιφῶν, and of its being brought
into the temples of Diana, and also to the places where three roads
meet, on the day when the moon is overtaken at its setting by the
rising of the sun; and so the heaven is ἀμφιφῶς, or all over
light.</p>

<p>There is the basynias too. Semus, in the second book of the Deliad,
says&mdash;"In the island of Hecate, the Delians sacrifice to Iris, offering
her the cheesecakes called basyniæ; and this is a cake of wheat-flour,
and suet, and honey, boiled up together: and what is called κόκκωρα consists of a fig and three nuts."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 1031]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">CHEESECAKES.</div>

<p>There are also cheesecakes called strepti and neëlata. Both these kinds
are mentioned by Demosthenes the orator, in his Speech in Defence of
Ctesiphon concerning the Crown.</p>

<p>There are also epichyta. Nicochares, in his Handicraftsmen, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">I've loaves, and barley-cakes, and bran, and flour,</div>

    <div class="verse">Dendalides, and fried bread.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>But Pamphilus says that the ἐπίχυτος is the same kind of
cheesecake as that which is called ἀττανίτης. And Hipponax
mentions the ἀττανίτης in the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse indent16">Not eating hares or woodcocks,</div>

    <div class="verse">Nor dipping attanitæ in honeycombs.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>There is also the creïum. This is a kind of cheesecake which, at Argos,
is brought to the bridegroom from the bride; and it is roasted on the
coals, and the friends of the bridegroom are invited to eat it; and it
is served up with honey, as Philetas tells us in his Miscellanies.</p>

<p>There is also the glycinas: this is a cheesecake in fashion among the
Cretans, made, with sweet wine and oil, as Seleucus tells us in his
Dialects.</p>

<p>There is also the empeptas. The same author speaks of this as a
cheesecake made of wheat, hollow and well-shaped, like those which are
called κρηπῖδες; being rather a kind of
paste into which they put those cheesecakes which are really made with
cheese.</p>

<p>54. There are cakes, also, called ἐγκρίδες. These are cakes
boiled in oil, and after that seasoned with honey; and they are
mentioned by Stesichorus in the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Groats and encrides,</div>
    <div class="verse">And other cakes, and fresh sweet honey.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Epicharmus, too, mentions them; and so does Nicophon, in his
Handicraftsmen. And Aristophanes, in his Danaides, speaks of a man who
made them in the following words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">And not be a seller of encrides (ἐγκριδοπώλης).</div>

    <div class="verse">Let him take this, and then along the road</div>
    <div class="verse">Let him seize some encrides.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>There is the ἐπικύκλιος, too. This is a kind of cheesecake
in use among the Syracusans, under this name; and it is mentioned by
Epicharmus, in his Earth and Sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 1032]</span></p>

<p>There is also the γοῦρος; and that this, too, is a kind of
cheesecake we learn from what Solon says in his Iambics:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Some spend their time in drinking, and eating cakes,</div>

    <div class="verse">Of dainty wanting there, but all the fruits</div>
    <div class="verse">Which the rich earth brings forth as food for men</div>
    <div class="verse">Are present in abundance.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>There are also cribanæ; and κριβάνης is a name given by Alcman
to some cheesecakes, as Apollodorus tells us. And Sosibius asserts the
same thing, in the third book of his Essay on Alcman; and he says they
are in shape like a breast, and that the Lacedæmonians use them at
the banquets of women, and that the female friends of the bride, who
follow her in a chorus, carry them about when they are going to sing an
encomium which has been prepared in her honour.</p>

<p>There is also the crimnites, which is a kind of cheesecake made of a
coarser sort of barley-meal (κρίμνον), as Iatrocles tells us
in his treatise on Cheesecakes.</p>

<p>55. Then there is the staitites; and this, too, is a species of
cheesecake made of wheaten-flour and honey. Epicharmus mentions it in
his Hebe's Wedding; but the wheaten-flour is wetted, and then put into
a frying-pan; and after that honey is sprinkled over it, and sesame,
and cheese; as Iatrocles tells us.</p>

<p>There is also the charisius. This is mentioned by Aristophanes in his
Daitaleis, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">But I will send them in the evening</div>
    <div class="verse">A charisian cheesecake.</div>

 </div>
</div>

<p>Then there is the ἐπίδαιτρον, which is a barley-cake, made
like a cheesecake, to be eaten after supper; as Philemon tells us in
his treatise on Attic Names.</p>

<p>There is also the nanus, which is a loaf made like a cheesecake,
prepared with cheese and oil.</p>

<p>There are also ψώθια, which are likewise called ψαθύρια.
Pherecrates, in the Crapatalli, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">CHEESECAKES.</div>

<p>But Apollodorus the Athenian, and Theodorus, in his treatise

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1033]</span>

on the Attic Dialect, say that the crumbs which are knocked off from a
loaf are called ψώθια, which some people also call ἀττάραγοι.</p>

<p>Then there is the ἴτριον.
This is a thin cake, made of sesame
and honey; and it is mentioned by Anacreon thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">

<p>There is mention made also of ἄμοραι. Philetas, in his
Miscellanies, says that cakes of honey are called ἄμοραι; and
they are made by a regular baker.</p>

<p>There is the ταγηνίτης, too; which is a cheesecake fried
in oil. Magnes, or whoever it was that wrote the comedies which are
attributed to him, says in the second edition of his Bacchus&mdash;</p>

festival of Elaphebolia, of wheat-flour, and honey, and sesame.</p>

<p>The ναστὸς is a kind of cheesecake, having stuffing inside it.</p>

<p>56. Χόρια are cakes made up with honey and milk.</p>

<p>The ἀμορβίτης is a species of cheesecake in fashion among the
Sicilians. But some people call it παισά. And among the Coans
it is called πλακούντιον, as we are informed by Iatrocles.</p>

<p>Then there are the σησαμίδες, which are cakes made of honey,

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 1034]</span></p>

<p>Then there are μύλλοι. Heraclides the Syracusan, in his treatise on
Laws, says, that in Syracuse, on the principal day of the Thesmophorian
festival, cakes of a peculiar shape are made of sesame and honey,
which are called μύλλοι throughout all Sicily, and are carried about
as offerings to the goddesses. There is also the echinus. Lynceus the
Samian, in his epistle to Diagoras, comparing the things which are
considered dainties in Attica with those which are in esteem at Rhodes,
writes thus: "They have for the second course a rival to the fame of
the ἄμης in a new antagonist called the ἐχινος, concerning which I will
speak briefly; but when you come and see me, and eat one which shall be
prepared for you in the Rhodian manner, then I will endeavour to say
more about it."</p>

<p>There are also cheesecakes named κοτυλίσκοι. Heracleon of
Ephesus tells us that those cheesecakes have this name which are made
of the third part of a chœnix of wheat.</p>

<p>There are others called χοιρίναι, which are mentioned by
Iatrocles in his treatise on Cheesecakes; and he speaks also of that
which is called πυραμοῦς, which he says differs from the
πυραμίς, inasmuch as this latter is made of bruised wheat
which has been softened with honey. And these cheesecakes are in
nightly festivals given as prizes to the man who has kept awake all
night.</p>

<p>57. But Chrysippus of Tyana, in his book called the Art of
Making Bread, enumerates the following species and genera of
cheesecakes:&mdash;"The terentinum, the crassianum, the tutianum, the
sabellicum, the clustron, the julianum, the apicianum, the canopicum,
the pelucidum, the cappadocium, the hedybium, the maryptum, the
plicium, the guttatum, the montianum. This last," he says, "you will
soften with sour wine, and if you have a little cheese you may mash
the montianum up half with wine and half with cheese, and so it will
be more palatable. Then there is the clustrum curianum, the clustrum
tuttatum, and the clustrum tabonianum. There are also mustacia made
with mead, mustacia made with sesame, crustum purium, gosgloanium, and
paulianum.</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">CHEESECAKES.</div>

<p>"The following cakes resembling cheesecakes," he says, "are really
made with cheese:&mdash;the enchytus, the scriblites, the subityllus. There
is also another kind of subityllus made of groats. Then there is the
spira; this, too, is made with cheese.</p>
<p>There are, too, the lucuntli, the argyrotryphema, the libos, the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1035]</span>

cercus, the æxaphas, the clustroplacous. There is also," says
Chrysippus, "a cheesecake made of rye. The phthois is made thus:&mdash;Take
some cheese and pound it, then put it into a brazen sieve and strain
it; then put in honey and a hemina<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
of flour made from spring wheat, and beat the whole together into one
mass.</p>

<p>"There is another cake, which is called by the Romans catillus ornatus,
and which is made thus:&mdash;Wash some lettuces and scrape them; then put
some wine into a mortar and pound the lettuces in it; then, squeezing
out the juice, mix up some flour from spring wheat in it, and allowing
it to settle, after a little while pound it again, adding a little
pig's fat and pepper; then pound it again, draw it out into a cake,
smoothe it, and cut it again, and cut it into shape, and boil it in hot
oil, putting all the fragments which you have cut off into a strainer.</p>

<p>"Other kinds of cheesecakes are the following:&mdash;the
ostracites, the attanites, the amylum, the tyrocoscinum. Make this
last thus:&mdash;Pound some cheese (τῦρον) carefully, and put it into
a vessel; then place above it a brazen sieve (κόσκινον) and strain the
cheese through it. And when you are going to serve it up, then put
in above it a sufficient quantity of honey. The cheesecakes called
ὑποτυρίδες are made thus:&mdash;Put some honey into some milk, pound
them, and put them into a vessel, and let them coagulate; then, if you
have some little sieves at hand, put what is in the vessel into them,
and let the whey run off; and when it appears to you to have coagulated
thoroughly, then take up the vessel in which it is, and transfer it to
a silver dish, and the coat, or crust, will be uppermost. But if you
have no such sieves, then use some new fans, such as those which are
used to blow the fire; for they will serve the same purpose. Then there
is the coptoplacous. And also," says he, "in Crete they make a kind of
cheesecake which they call gastris. And it is made thus:&mdash;Take
some Thasian and Pontic nuts and some almonds, and also a poppy. Roast
this last with great care, and then take the seed and pound it in a
clean mortar; then, adding the fruits which I have mentioned above,
beat them up with boiled honey, putting in plenty of pepper, and make
the whole into a soft mass, (but it will be of a black colour because
of the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1036]</span>

poppy;) flatten it and make it into a square shape; then, having
pounded some white sesame, soften that too with boiled honey, and draw
it out into two cakes, placing one beneath and the other above, so
as to have the black surface in the middle, and make it into a neat
shape." These are the recipes of that clever writer on confectionary,
Chrysippus.</p>

<p>58. But Harpocration the Mendesian, in his treatise on Cheesecakes,
speaks of a dish which the Alexandrians call παγκαρπία. Now
this dish consists of a number of cakes mashed up together and boiled
with honey. And after they are boiled, they are made up into round
balls, and fastened round with a thin string of byblus in order to
keep them together. There is also a dish called πόλτος, which
Alcman mentions in the following terms&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">And then we'll give you poltos made of beans (πυάνιος),</div>

    <div class="verse">And fruit of wax.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>But the substantive πυάνιον, as Sosibius tells us, means a
collection of all kinds of seeds boiled up in sweet wine. And χῖδρος
means boiled grains of wheat. And when he speaks here of waxy
fruit, he means honey. And Epicharmus, in his Earth and Sea, speaks
thus&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse">To boil some morning πόλτος.</div>

<p>And Pherecrates mentions the cakes called μελικηρίδων in his
Deserters, speaking as follows&mdash;</p>

<p>59. And when all this had been said, the wise Ulpian said,&mdash;Whence,
my most learned grammarians, and out of what library, have these
respectable writers, Chrysippus and Harpocration, been extracted, men
who bring the names of illustrious philosophers into disrepute by being
their namesakes? And what Greek has ever used the word ἡμίνα;
or who has ever mentioned the ἄμυλος?" And when Laurentius
answered him, and said,&mdash;Whoever the authors of the poems attributed to
Epicharmus were, they were acquainted with the ἡπίνα. And we
find the following expressions in the play entitled Chiron&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">CAKES.</div>

<p>And these spurious poems, attributed to Epicharmus, were, at all
events, written by eminent men. For it was Chrysogonus

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1037]</span>

the flute-player, as Aristoxenus tells us in the eighth book of his
Political Laws, who wrote the poem entitled Polity. And Philochorus,
in his treatise on Divination, says that it was a man of the name of
Axiopistos, (whether he was a Locrian or a Sicyonian is uncertain,) who
was the author of the Canon and the Sentences. And Apollodorus tells
us the same thing. And Teleclides mentions the ἄμυλος in his
Rigid Men, speaking thus&mdash;</p>

<p>60. When Ulpian had heard this, he said&mdash;But, since you have also a
cake which you call κοπτὴ, and I see that there is one served
up for each of you on the table, tell us now, you epicures, what writer
of authority ever mentions this word κοπτὴ? And Democritus
replied&mdash;Dionysius of Utica, in the seventh book of his Georgics, says
that the sea leek is called κοπτὴ. And as for the honey-cake
which is now served up before each of us, Clearchus the Solensian, in
his treatise on Riddles, mentions that, saying&mdash;"If any one were to
order a number of vessels to be mentioned which resemble one another,
he might say,</p>

<p>These are the words of Clearchus. But Sopater the farce-writer, in his

<p>Here my excellent cross-examiner, Ulpian, you have authorities
for κοπτή; and so now I advise you ἀπεσθίειν some. And he, without
any delay, took and ate some. And when they all laughed, Democritus
said;&mdash;But, my fine word-catcher, I did not desire you to eat, but
not to eat; for the word ἀπεσθίω is used in the sense of abstaining
from eating by Theopompus the comic poet, in his Phineus, where he
says&mdash;</p>

deal annoyed, said&mdash;But I see here on the table some pistachio nuts
(ψιττάκια); and if you can tell me what author has ever
spoken of them, I will give you, not ten golden staters, as that Pontic
trifler has it, but this goblet. And as Democritus made no reply, he
said, But since you cannot answer me, I will tell you; Nicander of
Colophon, in his Theriacans, mentions them, and says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>And Posidonius the Stoic, in the third book of his History, writes
thus: "But both Arabia and Syria produce the peach, and the nut which
is called βιστάκιον; which bears a fruit in bunches like
bunches of grapes, of a sort of tawny white, long shaped, like tears,
and the nuts lie on one another like berries. But the kernel is of a
light green, and it is less juicy than the pine-cone, but it has a more
pleasant smell. And the brothers who together composed the Georgics,
write thus, in the third book&mdash;"There is also the ash, and the
turpentine tree, which the Syrians call πιστάκια." And these
people spell the word πιστάκια with a π, but Nicander
writes it φιττάκια, and Posidonius βιστάκια.</p>

<p>62. And when he had said this, looking round on all those who were
present, and being praised by them, he said,&mdash;But I mean also
to discuss every other dish that there is on the table, in order to
make you admire my varied learning. And first of all I will speak of
those which the Alexandrians call κόνναρα and παλίουροι. And they are
mentioned also by Agathocles of Cyzicus, in the third book of his
History of his Country; where, he says: "But after the thunderbolt had
struck the tomb, there sprung up from the monument a tree which they
call κόνναρον. And this tree is not at all inferior in size to the
elm or the fir. And it has great numbers of branches, of great length
and rather thorny; but its leaf is tender and green, and of a round
shape. And it bears fruit twice a-year, in spring and autumn. And
the fruit is very sweet, and of the size of a phaulian olive, which
it resembles both in its flesh and in its stone; but it is superior
in the good flavour of its juice. And the fruit is eaten while still
green; and when it has become dry they make it into paste, and eat it
without either bruising it or softening it with water, but taking it in
very nearly its natural state. And Euripides, in the Cyclops, speaks
of&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>But Theopompus, in the twenty-first book of his History of Philip,
mentions them, and Diphilus, the physician of Siphnus, also speaks of
them, in his treatise on What may be eaten by People in Health, and by
Invalids. But I have mentioned these things first, my good friends, not
because they are before us at this moment, but because in the beautiful
city of Alexandria, I have often eaten them as part of the second
course, and as I have often heard the question as to their names raised
there, I happened to fall in with a book here in which I read what I
have now recounted to you.</p>

<p>63. And I will now take the pears (ἄπιον), which I see before
me, and speak of them, since it is from them that the Peloponnesus was
called Ἀπία,<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1040]</span>

because plants of the peartree were abundant in the country, as Ister
tells us, in his treatise on the History of Greece. And that it was
customary to bring up pears in water at entertainments, we learn from
the Breutias of Alexis, where we read these lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent-4"><i>B.</i> No doubt he does.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>But the fruit called ἁμαμηλίδες are not the same as pears, as
some people have fancied, but they are a different thing, sweeter, and
they have no kernel. Aristomenes, in his Bacchus, says&mdash;</p>

  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And Æschylides too, in the third book of his Georgics, shows us that it
is a different fruit from the pear, and sweeter. For he is speaking of
the island Ceos, and he expresses himself thus,&mdash;"The island produces
the very finest pears, equal to that fruit which in Ionia is called
hamamelis; for they are free from kernels, and sweet, and delicious."
But Aethlius, in the fifth book of his Samian Annals, if the book be
genuine, calls them homomelides. And Pamphilus, in his treatise on
Dialects and Names, says, "The epimelis is a species of pear." Antipho,
in his treatise on Agriculture, says that the phocides are also a kind
of pear.</p>

<p>64. Then there are pomegranates. And of pomegranates some kinds are
said to be destitute of kernels, and some to have hard ones. And those
without kernels are mentioned by Aristophanes in his Farmers; and in
his Anagyrus he says&mdash;</p>

 </div>
</div>

<p>But Agatharchides, in the nineteenth book of his History of
Europe, tells us that the Bœotians call pomegranates not ῥοιαὶ but
σίδαι, speaking thus:&mdash;"As the Athenians were disputing with
the Bœotians about a district which they called Sidæ, Epaminondas,
while engaged in upholding the claims of the Bœotians, suddenly
lifted up in his left hand a pomegranate which he had concealed,
and showed it to the Athenians, asking them what they called it,
and when they said ῥοιὰ, 'But we,' said he, 'call it σίδη.' And the
district bears the pomegranate-tree in great abundance, from which it
originally derived its name. And Epaminondas prevailed." And Menander,
in his Heauton-Timorumenos, called them ῥοίδια, in the following
lines&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse">Almonds, and after that we ate pomegranates.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>There is, however, another plant called sida, which is something like
the pomegranate, and which grows in the lake Orchomenus, in the water
itself; and the sheep eat its leaves, and the pigs feed on the young
shoots, as Theophrastus tells us, in the fourth book of his treatise on
Plants; where he says that there is another plant like it in the Nile,
which grows without any roots.</p>

<p>65. The next thing to be mentioned are dates. Xenophon, in the second
book of his Anabasis, says&mdash;"And there was in the district a great
deal of corn, and wine made of the dates, and also vinegar, which was
extracted from them; but the berries themselves of the date when like
what we see in Greece, were set apart for the slaves. But those which
were destined for the masters were all carefully selected, being of a
wonderful size and beauty, and their colour was like amber. And some
they dry and serve up as sweetmeats; and the wine made from the date
is sweet, but it produces headache." And Herodotus, in his first book,
speaking of Babylon, says,&mdash;"There are palm-trees there growing over
the whole plain, most of them being very fruitful; and they make bread,
and wine, and honey of them. And they manage the tree in the same way
as the fig-tree. For those palm-trees which they call the males they
take, and bind their fruit to the other palm-trees which bear dates,
in order that the insect which lives in the fruit of the male palm
may get into the date and ripen it,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1042]</span>

and so prevent the fruit of the date-bearing palm from being spoilt.
For the male palm has an insect in each of its fruits, as the wild fig
has." And Polybius of Megalopolis, who speaks with the authority of an
eye-witness, gives very nearly the same account of the lotus, as it
is called, in Libya, that Herodotus here gives of the palm-tree; for
he speaks thus of it: "And the lotus is a tree of no great size, but
rough and thorny, and its leaf is green like that of the rhamnus, but
a little thicker and broader. And the fruit at first resembles both in
colour and size the berries of the white myrtle when full grown; but as
it increases in size it becomes of a scarlet colour, and in size about
equal to the round olives; and it has an exceedingly small stone. But
when it is ripe they gather it. And some they store for the use of the
servants, bruising it and mixing it with groats, and packing it into
vessels. And that which is preserved for freemen is treated in the same
way, only that the stones are taken out, and then they pack that fruit
also in jars, and eat it when they please. And it is a food very like
the fig, and also like the palm-date, but superior in fragrance. And
when it is moistened and pounded with water, a wine is made of it, very
sweet and enjoyable to the taste, and like fine mead; and they drink
it without water; but it will not keep more than ten days, on which
account they only make it in small quantities as they want it. They
also make vinegar of the same fruit."</p>

<p>66. And Melanippides the Melian, in his Danaides, calls the fruit of
the palm-tree by the name of φοίνιξ, mentioning them in this
manner:&mdash;"They had the appearance of inhabitants of the shades below,
not of human beings; nor had they voices like women; but they drove
about in chariots with seats, through the woods and groves, just as
wild beasts do, holding in their hands the sacred frankincense, and
the fragrant dates (φοίνικας), and cassia, and the delicate
perfumes of Syria."<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">FIGS.</div>

<p>And Aristotle, in his treatise on Plants, speaks thus:&mdash;"The
dates (φοίνικες) without stones, which some call eunuchs and others
ἀπύρηνοι." Hellanicus has also called the fruit φοίνιξ, in his Journey
to the Temple of Ammon, if at least the book be a genuine one; and so
has Phormus the comic poet, in his Atalantæ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 1043]</span></p>

<p>But concerning those that are called the Nicolaan dates, which
are imported from Syria, I can give you this information; that
they received this name from Augustus the emperor, because he was
exceedingly fond of the fruit, and because Nicolaus of Damascus, who
was his friend, was constantly sending him presents of it. And this
Nicolaus was a philosopher of the Peripatetic School, and wrote a very
voluminous history.</p>

<p>67. Now with respect to dried figs. Those which came from Attica
were always considered a great deal the best. Accordingly Dinon, in
his History of Persia, says&mdash;"And they used to serve up at the royal
table all the fruits which the earth produces as far as the king's
dominions extend, being brought to him from every district as a sort
of first-fruits. And the first king did not think it becoming for the
kings either to eat or drink anything which came from any foreign
country; and this idea gradually acquired the force of a law. For once,
when one of the eunuchs brought the king, among the rest of the dishes
at dessert, some Athenian dried figs, the king asked where they came
from. And when he heard that they came from Athens, he forbade those
who had bought them to buy them for him any more, until it should be in
his power to take them whenever he chose, and not to buy them. And it
is said that the eunuch did this on purpose, with a view to remind him
of the expedition against Attica." And Alexis, in his Pilot, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Then came in figs, the emblem of fair Athens,</div>
    <div class="verse">And bunches of sweet thyme.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And Lynceus, in his epistle to the comic poet, Posidippus, says&mdash;"In
the delineation of the tragic passions, I do not think that Euripides
is at all superior to Sophocles, but in dried figs, I do think that
Attica is superior to every other country on earth." And in his
letter to Diagoras, he writes thus:&mdash;"But this country opposes to the
Chelidonian dried figs those which are called Brigindaridæ, which in
their name indeed are barbarous, but which in delicious flavour are not
at all less Attic than the others. And Phœnicides, in his Hated Woman,
says&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse">Which to a woodcock can for taste compare.</div>

<p>In which lines we must take notice of the mention of the woodcock.

But Philemon, in his treatise on Attic Names, says that "the most
excellent dried figs are those called Ægilides; and that Ægila is the
name of a borough in Attica, which derives its name from a hero called
Ægilus; but that the dried figs of a reddish black colour are called
Chelidonians." Theopompus also, in the Peace, praising the Tithrasian
figs, speaks thus&mdash;</p>

<p>But dried figs were so very much sought after by all men, (for really,

<p>that even Amitrochates, the king of the Indians, wrote to Antiochus,
entreating him (it is Hegesander who tells this story) to buy and send
him some sweet wine, and some dried figs, and a sophist; and that
Antiochus wrote to him in answer, "The dried figs and the sweet wine we
will send you; but it is not lawful for a sophist to be sold in Greece.
The Greeks were also in the habit of eating dried figs roasted, as
Pherecrates proves by what he says in the Corianno, where we find&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse">Their dishes.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>I am aware, too, that Pamphilus has mentioned a kind of dried figs,
which he calls προκνίδες.</p>

<p>68. That the word βότρυς is common for a bunch of grapes
is known to every one; and Crates, in the second book of his Attic
Dialect, uses the word σταφυλὴ, although it appears to be
a word of Asiatic origin; saying that in some of the ancient hymns
the word σταφυλὴ is used for βότρυς, as in the
following line:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Thick hanging with the dusky grapes (σταφυλῆσι) themselves.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote-left">GRAPES.</div>

<p>And that the word σταφυλὴ is used by Homer is known to every
one. But Plato, in the eighth book of his Laws, uses both βότρυς and
σταφυλὴ, where he says&mdash;"Whoever tastes wild fruit, whether it be
grapes (βοτρύων) or figs, before the time of the vintage arrives, which
falls at the time of the rising of Arcturus, whether it be on his own
farm, or on any one else's land, shall be fined fifty sacred drachmas
to be paid to Bacchus, if he plucked them off his own land; but a mina

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1045]</span>

if he gather them on a neighbour's estate; but if he take them from any
other place, two-thirds of a mina. But whoever chooses to gather the
grapes (τὴν σταφυλὴν), which are now called the noble grapes, or the
figs called the noble figs, if he gather them from his own trees, let
him gather them as he pleases, and when he pleases; but if he gathers
them from the trees of any one else without having obtained the leave
of the owner, then, in accordance with the law which forbids any one
to move what he has not placed, he shall be invariably punished."
These are the words of the divine Plato; but I ask now what is this
noble grape (γενναῖα), and this noble fig that he speaks of? And you may all
consider this point while I am discussing the other dishes which are on
the table. And Masurius said&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">But let us not postpone this till to-morrow,</div>
    <div class="verse">Still less till the day after.</div>
   </div>

 </div>
</div>

<p>When the philosopher says γενναῖα, he means εἰγενῆ,
<i>generous</i>, as Archilochus also uses the word&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Come hither, you are generous (γενναῖος);</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>or, perhaps, he means ἐπιγεγενημένα; that is to say, grafted.
For Aristotle speaks of grafted pears, and calls them ἑπεμβολάδες. And Demosthenes, in his speech
in defence of Ctesiphon, has the sentence, "gathering figs, and grapes
(βότρυς), and olives." And Xenophon, in
his Œconomics, says, "that grapes (τὰς σταφυλὰς) are ripened by the sun." And our ancestors also
have been acquainted with the practice of steeping grapes in wine.
Accordingly Eubulus, in his Catacollomenos, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">But take these grapes (βότρυς), and in neat wine pound them,</div>

    <div class="verse">Then make him eat them when well steep'd in wine.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And the poet, who is the author of the Chiron, which is generally
attributed to Pherecrates, says&mdash;</p>

   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And that every sort of autumn fruit was always plentiful at Athens,
Aristophanes testifies in his Horæ. Why, then, should that appear
strange which Aethlius the Samian asserts in the fifth book of his
Samian Annals, where he says, "The fig, and the grape, and the medlar,
and the apple, and the rose grow twice a-year?" And Lynceus, in his

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1046]</span>

letter to Diagoras, praising the Nicostratian grape, which grows in
Attica, and comparing it to the Rhodiacan, says, "As rivals of the
Nicostratian grapes they grow the Hipponian grape; which after the
month Hecatombæon (like a good servant) has constantly the same good
disposition towards its masters."</p>

<p>69. But as you have had frequent discussions about meats, and birds,
and pigeons, I also will tell you all that I, after a great deal of
reading, have been able to find out in addition to what has been

<p>Now with respect to the pheasant, Ptolemy the king, in the twelfth
book of his Memorabilia, speaking of the palace which there is at
Alexandria, and of the animals which are kept in it, says, "They have
also pheasants, which they call τέταροι, which they not only
used to send for from Media, but they also used to put the eggs under
broody hens, by which means they raised a number, so as to have enough
for food; for they call it very excellent eating." Now this is the
expression of a most magnificent monarch, who confesses that he himself
has never tasted a pheasant, but who used to keep these birds as a sort
of treasure. But if he had ever seen such a sight as this, when, in
addition to all those which have been already eaten, a pheasant is also
placed before each individual, he would have added another book to the
existing twenty-four of that celebrated history, which he calls his
Memorabilia. And Aristotle or Theophrastus, in his Commentaries, says,
"In pheasants, the male is not only as much superior to the female as
is usually the case, but he is so in an infinitely greater degree."</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">PEACOCKS.</div>

also which exists at Rome, he would have fled to his sacred Senate, as
though he had a second time been

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1047]</span>

driven out of his kingdom by his brother. For the multitude of these
birds is so great at Rome, that Antiphanes the comic poet, in his
Soldier or Tychon, may seem to have been inspired by the spirit of
prophecy, when he said&mdash;</p>

<p>And that they used to keep them tame in their houses, we learn from

<p>Menodotus the Samian also, in his treatise on the Treasures in the
Temple of the Samian Juno, says: "The peacocks are sacred to Juno;
and perhaps Samos may be the place where they were first produced and
reared, and from thence it was that they were scattered abroad over
foreign countries, in the same way as cocks were originally produced
in Persia, and the birds called guinea-fowl (μελεαγρίδες)
in Ætolia." On which account Antiphanes, in his Brothers by the same
Father, says&mdash;</p>

<p>On which account the peacock occurs on the coins of the Samians.</p>

<p>71. But since Menodotus has mentioned the guinea-fowl, we ourselves
also will say something on that subject. Clytus the Milesian, a pupil
of Aristotle, in the first book of his History of Miletus, writes

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1048]</span>

thus concerning them&mdash;"All around the temple of the Virgin Goddess
at Leros, there are birds called guinea-fowls. And the ground where
they are bred is marshy. And this bird is very devoid of affection
towards its young, and wholly disregards its offspring, so that the
priests are forced to take care of them. And it is about the size of a
very fine fowl of the common poultry, its head is small in proportion
to its body, having but few feathers, but on the top it has a fleshy
crest, hard and round, sticking up above the head like a peg, and of a
wooden colour. And over the jaws, instead of a beard, they have a long
piece of flesh, beginning at the mouth, redder than that of the common
poultry; but of that which exists in the common poultry on the top of
the beak, which some people call the beard, they are wholly destitute;
so that their beak is mutilated in this respect. But its beak is
sharper and larger than that of the common fowl; its neck is black,
thicker and shorter than that of common poultry. And its whole body is
spotted all over, the general colour being black, studded in every part
with thick white spots something larger than lentil seeds. And these
spots are ring-shaped, in the middle of patches of a darker hue than
the rest of the plumage: so that these patches present a variegated
kind of appearance, the black part having a sort of white tinge, and
the white seeming a good deal darkened. And their wings are all over
variegated with white, in serrated,<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
wavy lines, parallel to each other. And their legs are destitute of
spurs like those of the common hen. And the females are very like
the males, on which account the sex of the guinea-fowls is hard to
distinguish." Now this is the account given of guinea-fowls by the
Peripatetic philosopher.</p>

<p>"But the Athenians," as Philochorus tells us, "when they sacrifice
to the Seasons, do not roast, but boil their meat, entreating the
goddesses to defend them from all excessive droughts, and heats,
and to give increase to their crops by means of moderate warmth and
seasonable rains. For they argue that roasting is a kind of cookery
which does less good to the meat, while boiling not only removes all
its crudities, but has the power also of softening the hard parts, and
of making all the rest digestible. And it makes the food more tender
and wholesome, on which account they say also, that when meat has been
once boiled, it ought not to be warmed up again by either roasting or
boiling it; for any second process removes the good done by the first
dressing, as Aristotle tells us. And roast meat is more crude and
dry than boiled meat." But roast meat is called φλογίδες.

already been said by you? However, I will not omit what is related by
Hegesander in his Commentaries. For he says that the Samians, when

so alarmed at the noise made by partridges which rose up and flew away,
that they fled, and embarked on board their ships, and sailed away.</p>

<p>Concerning hares also Chamæleon says, in his treatise on Simonides,
that Simonides once, when supping with king Hiero, as there was no hare
set on the table in front of him as there was before all the other

<p>But Simonides was, in fact, a very covetous man, addicted to
disgraceful gain, as we are told by Chamæleon. And accordingly in
Syracuse, as Hiero used to send him everything necessary for his daily
subsistence in great abundance, Simonides used to sell the greater part

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1050]</span>

of what was sent to him by the king, and reserve only a small portion
for his own use. And when some one asked him the reason of his doing
so, he said&mdash;"In order that both the liberality of Hiero and my economy

Lacedæmonians in respect of eating, writing thus&mdash;"And the Thasians
sent to Agesilaus, when he arrived, all sorts of sheep and well-fed
oxen; and beside this, every kind of confectionery and sweetmeat. But
Agesilaus took the sheep and the oxen, but as for the confectionery and
sweetmeats, at first he did not know what they meant, for they were
covered up; but when he saw what they were, he ordered the slaves to
take them away, saying that it was not the custom of the Lacedæmonians
to eat such food as that. But as the Thasians pressed him to take them,
he said, Carry them to those men (pointing to the Helots) and give them
to them; saying that it was much better for those Helots to injure
their health by eating them, than for himself and the Lacedæmonians
whom he had with him." And that the Lacedæmonians were in the habit
of treating the Helots with great insolence, is related also by Myron
of Priene, in the second book of his History of Messene, where he
says&mdash;"They impose every kind of insulting employment on the Helots,
such as brings with it the most extreme dishonour; for they compel them
to wear caps of dogskin, and cloaks also of skins; and every year they
scourge them without their having committed any offence, in order to
prevent their ever thinking of emancipating themselves from slavery.
And besides all this, if any of them ever appear too handsome or
distinguished-looking for slaves, they impose death as the penalty, and
their masters also are fined for not checking them in their growth and
fine appearances. And they give them each a certain piece of land, and
fix a portion which they shall invariably bring them in from it."</p>

<p>75. And since there is a portion of a fore-quarter of pork which is
called πέρνα placed before each of us, let us say something
about it, if any one remembers having seen the word used anywhere.

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1052]</span>

For the best πέρναι are those from Cisalpine Gaul: those from
Cibyra in Asia are not much inferior to them, nor are those from Lycia.
And Strabo mentions them in the third book of his Geography, (and he
is not a very modern author). And he says also, in the seventh<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
book of the same treatise, that he was acquainted with Posidonius the
Stoic philosopher, of whom we have often spoken as a friend of Scipio
who took Carthage. And these are the words of Strabo&mdash;"In Spain,
in the province of Aquitania, is the city Pompelo, which one may
consider equivalent to Pompeiopolis, where admirable πέρναι
are cured, equal to the Cantabrian hams."</p>

<p>The comic poet Aristomenes, in his Bacchus, speaks of meat cured by
being sprinkled with salt, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">

  </div>

</div>

<p>And in his Jugglers he says&mdash;</p>

<p>The servant always ate some salted crab.</p>

<p>76. But since we have here "fresh cheese (τρόφαλις), the
glory of fair Sicily," let us, my friends, also say something about
cheese (τυρός). For Philemon, in his play entitled The
Sicilian, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">I once did think that Sicily could make</div>
    <div class="verse">This one especial thing, good-flavour'd cheese;</div>
    <div class="verse">But now I've heard this good of it besides,</div>
    <div class="verse">That not only is the cheese of Sicily good,</div>
    <div class="verse">But all its pigeons too: and if one speaks</div>

    <div class="verse">And so I think that island now supplies</div>
    <div class="verse">All sorts of dainties and of furniture.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>The Tromilican<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
cheese also has a high character, respecting which Demetrius
the Scepsian writes thus in his second book of the Trojan
Array&mdash;"Tromilea is a city of Achaia, near which a delicious
cheese is made of goat's milk, not to be compared with any other kind,
and it is called Tromilican. And Simonides mentions it in his Iambic
poem, which begins thus&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse">And there is the fine Achaian cheese,</div>

 </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 1053]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">CHEESE.</div>

<p>And Euripides, in his Cyclops, speaks of a harsh-tasted cheese, which
he calls ὀπίας τυρὸς, being curdled by the juice ὀπὸς
of the fig-tree&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">

   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>But since, by speaking in this way of all the things which are
now put on the table before us, I am making the Tromilican cheese
into the remains of the dessert, I will not continue this topic. For
Eupolis calls the relics of sweetmeats (τραγημάτων) and confectionery
ἀποτραγήματα. And ridiculing a man of the name of Didymias, he calls
him the ἀποτράγημα of a fox, either because he was little in person,
or as being cunning and mischievous, as Dorotheus of Ascalon says.
There are also thin broad cheeses, which the Cretans call females,
as Seleucus tells us, which they offer up at certain sacrifices. And
Philippides, in his play called the Flutes, speaks of some called
πυρίεφθαι (and this is a name given to those made of cream), when he
says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">

   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Having these πυρίεφθαι, and these herbs.</div>
   </div>

 </div>
</div>

<p>And perhaps all such things are included in this Macedonian term
ἐπιδειπνίδες. For all these things are provocatives to
drinking.</p>

<p>77. Now, while Ulpian was continuing the conversation in this way,
one of the cooks, who made some pretence to learning, came in, and
proclaimed μύμα. And when many of us were perplexed at this
proclamation, (for the rascal did not show what it was that he had,)
he said;&mdash;You seem to me, O guests, to be ignorant that Cadmus, the
grandfather of Bacchus, was a cook. And, as no one made any reply to
this, he said; Euhemerus the Coan, in the third book of his Sacred
History, relates that the Sidonians give this account, that Cadmus was
the cook of the king, and that he, having taken Harmonia, who was a
female flute-player and also a slave of the king, fled away with her.&mdash;</p>

   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">But shall I flee, who am a freeman born?</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>For no one can find any mention in any comedy of a cook being a slave,
except in a play of Posidippus. But the introduction of slaves as cooks
took place among the Macedonians first, who adopted this custom either
out of insolence, or on account of the misfortunes of some cities which

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1054]</span>

had been reduced to slavery. And the ancients used to call a cook who
was a native of the country, Mæson; but if he was a foreigner, they
called him Tettix. And Chrysippus the philosopher thinks the name
Μαίσων is derived from the verb μασάομαι, to eat; a
cook being an ignorant man, and the slave of his appetite; not knowing
that Mæson was a comic actor, a Megarian by birth, who invented the
mask which was called Μαίσων, from him; as Aristophanes of
Byzantium tells us, in his treatise on Masks, where he says that
he invented a mask for a slave and also one for a cook. So that it
is a deserved compliment to him to call the jests which suit those
characters μαισωνικά.</p>

<p>For cooks are very frequently represented on the stage as jesting
characters; as, for instance, in the Men selecting an Arbitrator, of
Menander. And Philemon in one of his plays says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">

    <div class="verse">'Tis a male sphinx, it seems, and not a cook,</div>

    <div class="verse">With every kind of new expression.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>But Polemo says, in his writings which are addressed to Timæus, that
Mæson was indeed a Megarian, but from Megara in Sicily, and not from
Nisæa. And Posidippus speaks of slaves as cooks, in his Woman Shut out,
where he says&mdash;</p>

<p>78. And there was nothing extraordinary in the ancient cooks being
experienced in sacrifices. At all events, they usually managed all
marriage-feasts and sacrifices. On which account Menander, in his
Flatterer, introduces a cook, who on the fourth day of the month had
been ministering in the festival of Aphrodite Pandemus, using the
following language&mdash;</p>

<p>And the letter of Olympias to Alexander mentions the great experience
of cooks in these matters. For, his mother having been entreated by
him to buy him a cook who had experience in sacrifices, proceeds to
say, "Accept the cook Pelignas from your mother; for he is thoroughly
acquainted with the manner in which all your ancestral sacrifices, and
all the mysterious rites, and all the sacred mysteries connected with
the worship of Bacchus are performed, and every other sacrifice which
Olympias practises he knows. Do not then disregard him, but accept him,
and send him back again to me at as early a period as possible."</p>

<p>79. And that in those days the cook's profession was a respectable
one, we may learn from the Heralds at Athens. "For these men used
to perform the duties of cooks and also of sacrifices of victims,"
as Clidemus tells us, in the first book of his Protogony; and
Homer uses the verb ῥέζω, as we use θύω; but he uses θύω
as we do θυμιάω, for burning cakes and
incense after supper. And the ancients used also to employ the verb
δράω for to sacrifice; accordingly Clidemus
says, "The heralds used to sacrifice (ἔδρων)
for a long time, slaying the oxen, and preparing them, and cutting
them up, and pouring wine over them. And they were called κήρυκες from the hero Ceryx; and there is nowhere
any record of any reward being given to a cook, but only to a herald."
For Agamemnon in Homer, although he is king, performs sacrifices
himself; for the poet says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">With that the chief the tender victims slew,</div>

<p>And Thrasymedes the son of Nestor, having taken an axe, slays the ox
which was to be sacrificed, because Nestor himself was not able to do

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1056]</span>

so, by reason of his old age; and his other
brothers assisted him; so respectable and important was the office of
a cook in those days. And among the Romans, the Censors,&mdash;and that was
the highest office in the whole state,&mdash;clad in a purple robe, and
wearing crowns, used to strike down the victims with an axe. Nor is it
a random assertion of Homer, when he represents the heralds as bringing
in the victims, and whatever else had any bearing on the ratification
of oaths, as this was a very ancient duty of theirs, and one which was
especially a part of their office&mdash;</p>

<p>80. And in the first book of the History of Attica, Clidemus says, that
there was a tribe of cooks, who were entitled to public honours; and
that it was their business to see that the sacrifices were performed
with due regularity. And it is no violation of probability in Athenion,
in his Samothracians, as Juba says, when he introduces a cook arguing
philosophically about the nature of things and men, and saying&mdash;</p>

practised by freeborn men; for a cook is represented in that play as

of cookery is one in which it is not even every freeborn man who can
become eminent. And the younger Cratinus, in his play called the

<p>82. And such a food now is the μύμα, which I, my friends, am
bringing you; concerning which Artemidorus, the pupil of Aristophanes,
speaks in his Dictionary of Cookery, saying that it is prepared with
meat and blood, with the addition also of a great deal of seasoning.
And Epænetus, in his treatise on Cookery, speaks as follows:&mdash;"One
must make μύμα of every kind of animal and bird, cutting up
the tender parts of the meat into small pieces, and the bowels and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1059]</span>

entrails, and pounding the blood, and seasoning it with vinegar, and
roasted cheese, and assafœtida, and cummin-seed, and thyme (both green
and dry), and savory, and coriander-seed (both green and dry), and
leeks, and onions (cleaned and toasted), and poppy-seed, and grapes,
and honey, and the pips of an unripe pomegranate. You may also make
this μύμα of fish."</p>

<p>83. And when this man had thus hammered on not only this dish but
our ears also, another slave came in, bringing in a dish called
ματτύη. And when a discussion arose about this, and when
Ulpian had quoted a statement out of the Dictionary of Cookery by the
before-mentioned Artemidorus relating to it, Æmilianus said that a book
had been published by Dorotheus of Ascalon, entitled, On Antiphanes,
and on the dish called Mattya by the Poets of the New Comedy, which
he says is a Thessalian invention, and that it became naturalized at
Athens during the supremacy of the Macedonians. And the Thessalians are
admitted to be the most extravagant of all the Greeks in their manner
of dressing and living; and this was the reason why they brought the
Persians down upon the Greeks, because they were desirous to imitate
their luxury and extravagance. And Cratinus speaks of their extravagant
habits in his treatise on the Thessalian Constitution. But the dish
was called ματτύη (as Apollodorus the Athenian affirms in
the first book of his treatise on Etymologies), from the verb
μασάομαι (to eat); as also are the words μαστίχη (mastich)
and μάζα (barley-cake). But our own opinion is that the word
is derived from μάττω, and that this is the verb from which
μάζα itself is derived, and also the cheese-pudding called by
the Cyprians μαγίς; and from this, too, comes the verb
ὑπερμαζάω, meaning to be extravagantly luxurious.
Originally they used to call this common ordinary food made of barley-meal
μάζα, and preparing it they called μάττω. And afterwards,
varying the necessary food in a luxurious and superfluous manner, they
derived a word with a slight change from the form μάζα, and
called every very costly kind of dish ματτύη; and preparing
such dishes they called ματτυάζω, whether it were fish, or
poultry, or herbs, or beasts, or sweetmeats. And this is plain from
the testimony of Alexis, quoted by Artemidorus; for Alexis, wishing
to show the great luxuriousness of the way in which this dish was
prepared, added the verb λέπομαι. And the whole extract runs
thus, being out of a corrected edition of a play which is entitled

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1060]</span>

Demetrius:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Take, then, this meat which thus is sent to you;</div>
    <div class="verse">Dress it, and feast, and drink the cheerful healths,</div>
    <div class="verse">λέπεσθε, ματτυάζετε.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>But the Athenians use the verb λέπομαι for wanton and unseemly
indulgence of the sensual appetites.</p>

<p>84. And Artemidorus, in his Dictionary of Cookery, explains
ματτύη as a common name for all kinds of costly seasonings; writing
thus&mdash;"There is also a ματτύης (he uses the word in the
masculine gender) made of birds. Let the bird be killed by thrusting
a knife into the head at the mouth; then let it be kept till the next
day, like a partridge. And if you choose, you can leave it as it is,
the wings on and with its body plucked." Then, having explained the way
in which it is to be seasoned and boiled, he proceeds to say&mdash;"Boil a
fat hen of the common poultry kind, and some young cocks just beginning
to crow, if you wish to make a dish fit to be eaten with your wine.
Then taking some vegetables, put them in a dish, and place upon them
some of the meat of the fowl, and serve it up. But in summer, instead
of vinegar, put some unripe grapes into the sauce, just as they are
picked from the vine; and when it is all boiled, then take it out
before the stones fall from the grapes, and shred in some vegetables.
And this is the most delicious ματτύης that there is."</p>

<p>Now, that ματτύη, or ματτύης, really is a common
name for all costly dishes is plain; and that the same name was also
given to a banquet composed of dishes of this sort, we gather from what
Philemon says in his Man carried off:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Put now a guard on me, while naked, and</div>

<p>And in his Homicide he says&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse">Let some one pour us now some wine to drink,</div>

   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote-left">MATTYH.</div>

<p>But Alexis, in his Pyraunus, has used the word in an obscure sense:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">But when I found them all immersed in business,</div>
    <div class="verse">I cried,&mdash;Will no one give us now a ματτύη?</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>as if he meant a feast here, though you might fairly refer the word
merely to a single dish. Now Machon the Sicyonian is one of the comic
poets who were contemporaries of Apollodorus of Carystus, but he did
not exhibit his comedies at

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1061]</span>

Athens, but in Alexandria; and he was an excellent poet, if ever there
was one, next to those seven<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
of the first class. On which account, Aristophanes the grammarian, when
he was a very young man, was very anxious to be much with him. And he
wrote the following lines in his play entitled Ignorance:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">

   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">There's nothing that I'm fonder of than ματτύη;</div>

    <div class="verse">I know not; but it must have been a person</div>

  </div>

<p>85. And that it used to be served up after all the rest of the banquet
was over, is plainly stated by Nicostratus, in his Man expelled. And it
is a cook who is relating how beautiful and well arranged the banquet
was which he prepared; and having first of all related what the dinner
and supper were composed of, and then mentioning the third meal,
proceeds to say&mdash;</p>

<p>But Molpis the Lacedæmonian says that what the Spartans call
ἐπαίκλεια, that is to say, the second course, which is served up when

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1062]</span>

the main part of the supper is over, is called
μάττυαι by other tribes of Greece. And Menippus the Cynic, in
his book called Arcesilaus, writes thus:&mdash;"There was a drinking-party
formed by a certain number of revellers, and a Lacedæmonian woman
ordered the ματτύη to be served up; and immediately some
little partridges were brought in, and some roasted geese, and some
delicious cheesecakes."</p>

<p>But such a course as this the Athenians used to call ἐπιδόρπισμα,
and the Dorians ἐπάϊκλον; but most of the Greeks called it τὰ ἐπίδειπνα
.</p>

<p>And when all this discussion about the ματτύη was over, they
thought it time to depart; for it was already evening. And so we parted.</p>

The Greek word is χρώματα: "As a technical term
in Greek music, χρῶμα was a modification of the simplest
or diatonic music; but there were also χρώματα as further
modifications of all the three common kinds (diatonic, chromatic,
and enharmonic)." Liddell and Scott, <i>in voc.</i> Smith, Dict. Gr. and
Rom. Ant. v. <i>Music</i>, p. 625 <i>a</i>, calls them χρόαι, and says
there were six of them; one in the enharmonic genus, often called
simply ἁρμονία; two in the diatonic, 1st, διάτονον σίντονον, or simply διάτονον,
the same as the genus; 2d, διάτονον μαλακόν: and three in the chromatic,
1st,χρῶμα τονιαῖον, or simply χρῶμα, the same as the genus; 2d, χρῶμα ἡμιόλιον; 3d, χρῶμα μαλακόν. <i>V. loc.</i></p>

<p>to recapitulate to you the numerous things which were said in those
most admirable banquets, on account of the varied nature of the topics
introduced, and the novel mode in which they were continually treated.
For there were frequent discussions about the order in which the dishes
were served up, and about the things which are done after the chief
part of the supper is over, such as I can hardly recollect; and some
one of the guests quoted the following iambics from The Lacedæmonians
of Plato&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">THE COTTABUS.</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">

    <div class="verse">Now nearly all the men have done their supper;</div>

   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>2. And after this quotation there arose, I think, a discussion
about the cottabus and cottabus-players. Now by the term
ἀποκοτταβίζοντες, one of the physicians who were present thought those
people were meant, who, after the bath, for the sake of purging their
stomach, drink a full draught of wine and then throw it up again; and
he said that this was not an ancient custom, and that he was not aware
of any ancient author who had alluded to this mode of purging. On which
account Erasistratus of Julia, in his treatise on Universal Medicine,
reproves those who act in this way, pointing out that it is a practice
very injurious to the eyes, and having a very astringent effect on the
stomach. And Ulpian addressed him thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Arise, Machaon, great Charoneus calls.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>For it was wittily said by one of our companions, that if there were
no physicians there would be nothing more stupid than grammarians.
For who is there of us who does not know that this kind of
ἀποκοτταβισμὸς was not that of the ancients? unless you think that the
cottabus-players of Ameipsias vomited. Since, then, you are ignorant
of what this is which is the subject of our present discussion, learn
from me, in the first place, that the cottabus is a sport of Sicilian
invention, the Sicilians having been the original contrivers of it, as
Critias the son of Callæschrus tells us in his Elegies, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">The cottabus comes from Sicilian lands,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And a glorious invention I think it,</div>
    <div class="verse">Where we put up a target to shoot at with drops</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">From our wine-cup whenever we drink it.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And Dicæarchus the Messenian, the pupil of Aristotle, in his

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1064]</span>

treatise on Alcæus, says that the word λατάγη is also a
Sicilian noun. But λατάγη means the drops which are left in
the bottom after the cup is drained, and which the players used to
throw with inverted hand into the κοτταβεῖον. But Clitarchus,
in his treatise on Words, says that the Thessalians and Rhodians both
call the κότταβος itself, or splash made by the cups, λατάγη.</p>

<p>3. The prize also which was proposed for those who gained the victory
in drinking was called κότταβος, as Euripides shows us in his
Œneus, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">And then with many a dart of Bacchus' juice,</div>
    <div class="verse">They struck the old man's head. And I was set</div>
    <div class="verse">To crown the victor with deserved reward,</div>
    <div class="verse">And give the cottabus to such.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>The vessel, too, into which they threw the drops was also called
κότταβος, as Cratinus shows in his Nemesis. But Plato the
comic poet, in his Jupiter Ill-treated, makes out that the cottabus was
a sort of drunken game, in which those who were defeated yielded up
their tools<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> to the victor. And these are his words&mdash;</p>

<p>5. For a man must curve his hand excessively before he can throw the
cottabus elegantly, as Dicæarchus says; and Plato intimates as much in
his Jupiter Ill-treated, where some one calls out to Hercules not to
hold his hand too stiff, when he is going to play the cottabus. They
also called the very act of throwing the cottabus ἀπ' ἀγκύλης,
because they curved (ἀπαγκυλόω) the right hand in throwing it.
Though some say that ἀγκύλη, in this phrase, means a kind of
cup. And Bacchylides, in his Love Poems, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>Now, that he who succeeded in throwing the cottabus properly received
a prize, Antiphanes has shown us in a passage already quoted. And
the prize consisted of eggs, sweetmeats, and confectionery. And

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1066]</span>

Cephisodorus, in his Trophonius, and Callias or Diocles, in the
Cyclopes, (whichever of the two is the author,) and Eupolis, and
Hermippus, in his Iambics, prove the same thing.</p>

<p>Now what is called the κατακτὸς cottabus was something of this
kind. There is a high lamp, having on it what is called the Manes, on
which the dish, when thrown down, ought to fall; and from thence it
falls into the platter which lies below, and which is struck by the
cottabus. And there was room for very great dexterity in throwing the
cottabus. And Nicochares speaks of the Manes in his Lacedæmonians.</p>

<p>6. There is also another way of playing this game with a platter. This
platter is filled with water, and in it there are floating some empty
saucers, at which the players throw their drops out of their cups,
and endeavour to sink them. And he who has succeeded in sinking the
greatest number gains the victory. Ameipsias, in his play entitled The
Men playing at the Cottabus or Mania, says&mdash;</p>

<p>And the poet uses λέγοντες here, because they used to utter
the names of their sweethearts as they threw the cottabi on the
saucers. On which account Sophocles, in his Inachus, called the drops
which were thrown, sacred to Venus&mdash;</p>

 </div>
</div>

<p>7. There was also another kind of way of playing at the cottabus, in
the feasts which lasted all night, which is mentioned by Callippus in
his Festival lasting all Night, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">

    <div class="verse">Who are at hand.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>There were also sweetmeats at these nocturnal festivals, in which
the men continued awake an extraordinary time dancing. And these
sweetmeats used to be called at that time χαρίσιοι, from the
joy (χαρὰ) of those who received them. And Eubulus, in his
Ancylion, mentions them, speaking as follows&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">For he has long been cooking prizes for</div>
    <div class="verse">The victors in the cottabus.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And presently afterwards he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">I then sprang out to cook the χαρίσιος.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>But that kisses were also given as the prize Eubulus tells us in a
subsequent passage&mdash;</p>

   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Come now, ye women, come and dance all night,</div>

    <div class="verse">And five fine apples, and nine kisses too.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>But that the cottabus was a sport to which the Sicilians were greatly
addicted, is plain from the fact that they had rooms built adapted
to the game; which Dicæarchus, in his treatise on Alcæus, states to
have been the case. So that it was not without reason that Callimachus
affixed the epithet of Sicilian to λάταξ. And Dionysius, who
was surnamed the Brazen, mentions both the λάταγες and the
κότταβοι in his Elegies, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

these lines out of the same collection of Elegies&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>In answer to whom Cynulcus, who was always ready for a tilt at the
Syrian, and who never let the quarrel drop which he had against him,
now that there was a sort of tumult in the party, said&mdash;What is this
chorus of Syrbenians?<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
And I myself also recollect some lines of this poetry, which I will
quote, that Ulpian may not give himself airs as being the only one who
was able to extract anything about the cottabus out of those old stores
of the Homeridæ&mdash;</p>

<p>which have a clear reference to the present discussion. For I see the
servants now bringing us garlands and perfumes. Why now are those who
are crowned said to be in love when their crowns are broken? For when
I was a boy, and when I used to read the Epigrams of Callimachus, in
which this is one of the topics dilated on, I was anxious to understand
this point. For the poet of Cyrene says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

   <div class="smaller">

<p>So now it is your business, you most accomplished man, to
explain this difficulty which has occupied me these thousand

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1069]</span>

years, O Democritus, and to tell me why lovers crown the doors of their
mistresses.</p>

<p>9. And Democritus replied&mdash;But that I may quote some of the verses
of this Brazen poet and orator Dionysius, (and he was called
Brazen because he advised the Athenians to adopt a brazen coinage;
and Callimachus mentions the oration in his list of Oratorical
Performances,) I myself will cite some lines out of his Elegies. And do
you, O Theodorus, for this is your proper name&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>You ask, then, why, if the garlands of men who have been crowned are
pulled to pieces, they are said to be in love. "Is it, since love takes
away the strict regularity of manners in the case of lovers, that on
this account they think the loss of a conspicuous ornament, a sort
of beacon (as Clearchus says, in the first book of his Art of Love)
and signal, that they to whom this has happened have lost the strict
decorum of their manners? Or do men interpret this circumstance also by
divination, as they do many other things? For the ornament of a crown,
as there is nothing lasting in it, is a sort of emblem of a passion
which does not endure, but assumes a specious appearance for a while:
and such a passion is love. For no people are more careful to study
appearance than those who are in love. Unless, perhaps, nature, as a
sort of god, administering everything with justice and equity, thinks
that lovers ought not to be crowned till they have subdued their love;
that is to say, till, having prevailed upon the object of their love,
they are released from their desire. And accordingly, the loss of their
crown we make the token of their being still occupied in the fields of
love. Or perhaps Love himself, not permitting any one to be crowned in
opposition to, or to be proclaimed as victor over himself, takes their
crowns from these men, and gives the perception of this to others,
indicating that these men are subdued by him: on which account all
the rest say that these men are in love. Or is it because that cannot
be loosed which has never been bound, but love is the chain of some

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1070]</span>

who wear crowns, (for no one else who is bound is more anxious about
being crowned than a lover,) that men consider that the loosing of the
garland is a sign of love, and therefore say that these men are in
love? Or is it because very often lovers, when they have been crowned,
often out of agitation as it should seem, allow their crowns to fall to
pieces, and so we argue backwards, and attribute this passion to all
whom we see in this predicament; thinking that their crown never would
have come to pieces, if they had not been in love? Or is it because
these loosings happen only in the case of men bound or men in love; and
so, men thinking that the loosing of the garland is the loosing also
of those who are bound, consider that such men are in love? For those
in love are bound, unless you would rather say that, because those who
are in love are crowned with love, therefore their crown is not of a
lasting kind; for it is difficult to put a small and ordinary kind of
crown on a large and divine one. Men also crown the doors of the houses
of the objects of their love, either with a view to do them honour, as
they adorn with crowns the vestibule of some god to do him honour: or
perhaps the offering of the crowns is made, not to the beloved objects,
but to the god Love. For thinking the beloved object the statue, as
it were, of Love, and his house the temple of Love, they, under this
idea, adorn with crowns the vestibules of those whom they love. And for
the same reason some people even sacrifice at the doors of those whom
they love. Or shall we rather say that people who fancy that they are
deprived, or who really have been deprived of the ornament of their
soul, consecrate to those who have deprived them of it, the ornament
also of their body, being bewildered by their passion, and despoiling
themselves in order to do so? And every one who is in love does this
when the object of his love is present, but when he is not present,
then he makes this offering in the public roads. On which account
Lycophronides has represented that goatherd in love, as saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>10. Moreover, that most divine writer Plato, in the seventh book of his
Laws, proposes a problem having reference to crowns, which it is worth
while to solve; and these are the words of the philosopher:&mdash;"Let there
be distributions of apples and crowns to a greater and a lesser number
of people, in such a way that the numbers shall always be equal." These
are the words of Plato. But what he means is something of this sort. He
wishes to find one number of such a nature that, if divided among all
who come in to the very last, it shall give an equal number of apples
or crowns to every one. I say, then, that the number sixty will fulfil
these conditions of equality in the case of six fellow-feasters; for I
am aware that at the beginning we said that a supper party ought not
to consist of more than five. But we are as numerous as the sand of
the sea. Accordingly the number sixty, when the party is completed to
the number of six guests, will begin to be divided in this manner. The
first man came into the banqueting-room, and received sixty garlands.
He gives to the second who comes in half of them; and then each of
them have thirty. Then when a third comes in they divide the whole
sixty, so that each of them may have twenty. Again, they divide them
again in like manner at the entrance of a fourth guest, so that each
has fifteen; and when a fifth comes in they all have twelve a-piece.
And when the sixth guest arrives, they divide them again, and each
individual has ten. And in this way the equal division of the garlands
is accomplished.</p>

<p>11. When Democritus had said this, Ulpian, looking towards Cynulcus,
said&mdash;</p>

<p>For where was it that you got that idea of the Chorus of the
Syrbenians? What author worth speaking of mentions that musical chorus?
And he replied:&mdash;My good friend, I will not teach you, unless I first
receive adequate pay from you; for I do not read to pick out all the
thorns out of my books as you do, but I select only what is most useful
and best worth hearing.

out these lines out of the Suspicion of Alexis&mdash;</p>

<p>And the same iambics occur in the Sleep of Antiphanes. And Cynulcus

us, my good Ulpian, what is the meaning of the expression, "The garland

<p>And why also does the same poet represent some people as crowned with
osiers? for in the second book of his Odes, he says&mdash;</p>

   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>For to suppose that these crowns were really made of osiers is absurd,
for the osier is fit only for plaiting and binding. So now tell us
about these things, my friend, for they are worth understanding
correctly, and do not keep us quibbling about words.</p>

<p>12. But as he made no reply, and pretended to be considering the
matter, Democritus said:&mdash;Aristarchus the grammarian, my friend, when
interpreting this passage, said that the ancients used to wear crowns
of willow. But Tenarus says that the willow or osier is the rustics'
crown. And other interpreters have said many irrelevant things on the
subject. But I, having met with a book of Menodotus of Samos, which
is entitled, A Record of the things worth noting at Samos, found
there what I was looking for; for he says that "Admete, the wife of
Eurystheus, after she had fled from Argos, came to Samos, and there,
when a vision of Juno had appeared to her, she wishing to give the
goddess a reward because she had arrived in Samos from her own home
in safety, undertook the care of the temple, which exists even to
this day, and which had been
originally built by the Leleges and the Nymphs. But the Argives hearing

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1073]</span>

of this, and being indignant at it, persuaded the Tyrrhenians by a
promise of money, to employ piratical force and to carry off the
statue,&mdash;the Argives believing that if this were done Admete
would be treated with every possible severity by the inhabitants of
Samos. Accordingly the Tyrrhenians came to the port of Juno, and having
disembarked, immediately applied themselves to the performance of their
undertaking. And as the temple was at that time without any doors, they
quickly carried off the statue, and bore it down to the seaside, and
put it on board their vessel. And when they had loosed their cables
and weighed anchor, they rowed as fast as they could, but were unable
to make any progress. And then, thinking that this was owing to divine
interposition, they took the statue out of the ship again and put it
on the shore; and having made some sacrificial cakes, and offered
them to it, they departed in great fear. But when, the first thing in
the morning, Admete gave notice that the statue had disappeared, and
a search was made for it, those who were seeking it found it on the
shore. And they, like Carian barbarians, as they were, thinking that
the statue had run away of its own accord, bound it to a fence made of
osiers, and took all the longest branches on each side and twined them
round the body of the statue, so as to envelop it all round. But Admete
released the statue from these bonds, and purified it, and placed it
again on its pedestal, as it had stood before. And on this account once
every year, since that time, the statue is carried down to the shore
and hidden, and cakes are offered to it: and the festival is called
Τονεὺς, because it happened that the statue was bound tightly
(συντόνως) by those who made the first search for it.</p>

<p>13. "But they relate that about that time the Carians, being
overwhelmed with superstitious fears, came to the oracle of the god
at Hybla, and consulted him with reference to these occurrences; and
that Apollo told them that they must give a voluntary satisfaction to
the god of their own accord, to escape a more serious calamity,&mdash;such
as in former times Jupiter had inflicted upon Prometheus, because of
his theft of the fire, after he had released him from a most terrible
captivity. And as he was inclined to give a satisfaction which should
not cause him severe pain, this was what the god imposed upon him.

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1074]</span>

And from this circumstance the use of this kind of crown which had
been shown to Prometheus got common among the rest of mankind who had
been benefited by him by his gift of fire: on which account the god
enjoined the Carians also to adopt a similar custom,&mdash;to use osiers
as a garland, and bind their heads with the branches with which
they themselves had bound the goddess. And he ordered them also to
abandon the use of every other kind of garland except that made of the
bay-tree: and that tree he said he gave as a gift to those alone who
are employed in the service of the goddess. And he told them that,
if they obeyed the injunctions given them by the oracle, and if in
their banquets they paid the goddess the satisfaction to which she
was entitled, they should be protected from injury: on which account
the Carians, wishing to obey the commands laid on them by the oracle,
abolished the use of those garlands which they had previously been
accustomed to wear, but permitted all those who were employed in the
service of the goddess still to wear the garland of bay-tree, which
remains in use even to this day.</p>

<p>14. "Nicænetus also, the epic poet, appears to make some allusion to
the fashion of wearing garlands of osier in his Epigrams. And this
poet was a native of Samos, and a man who in numberless passages shows
his fondness for mentioning points connected with the history of his
country. And these are his words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">I am not oft, O Philotherus, fond</div>
    <div class="verse">Of feasting in the city, but prefer</div>
    <div class="verse">The country, where the open breeze of zephyr</div>
    <div class="verse">Freshens my heart; a simple bed</div>
    <div class="verse">Beneath my body is enough for me,</div>
    <div class="verse">Made of the branches of the native willow (πρόμαλος),</div>
    <div class="verse">And osier (λύγος), ancient garland of the Carians,&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse">But let good wine be brought, and the sweet lyre,</div>
    <div class="verse">Chief ornament of the Pierian sisters,</div>
    <div class="verse">That we may drink our fill, and sing the praise</div>

    <div class="verse">The great protecting queen of this our isle.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote-left">GARLANDS.</div>

<p>But in the selines Nicænetus speaks ambiguously, for it is not quite
plain whether he means that the osier is to make his bed or his
garland; though afterwards, when he calls it the ancient garland of the
Carians, he alludes clearly enough to what we are now discussing. And
this use of osiers to

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1075]</span>

make into garlands, lasted in that island down to the time of
Polycrates, as we may conjecture. At all events Anacreon says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">But now full twice five months are gone</div>

   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>15. And the Gods know that I first found all this out in the beautiful
city of Alexandria, having got possession of the treatise of Menodotus,
in which I showed to many people the passage in Anacreon which is the
subject of discussion. But Hephæstion, who is always charging every one
else with thefts, took this solution of mine, and claimed it as his
own, and published an essay, to which he gave this title, "Concerning
the Osier Garland mentioned by Anacreon." And a copy of this essay we
lately found at Rome in the possession of the antiquary Demetrius.
And this compiler Hephæstion behaved in the same way to our excellent
friend Adrantus. For after he had published a treatise in five books,
Concerning those Matters in Theophrastus in his books on Manners,
which are open to any Dispute, either as to their Facts, or the Style
in which they are mentioned; and had added a sixth book Concerning
the Disputable Points in the Nicomachean Ethics of Aristotle; and in
these books had entered into a long dissertation on the mention of
Plexippus by Antipho the tragic poet, and had also said a good deal
about Antipho himself; Hephæstion, I say, appropriated all these books
to himself, and wrote another book, Concerning the Mention of Antipho
in the Memorabilia of Xenophon, not having added a single discovery or
original observation of his own, any more than he had in the discussion
on the Osier Garland. For the only thing he said that was new, was that
Phylarchus, in the seventh book of his Histories, mentioned this story
about the osier, and knew nothing of the passage of Nicænetus, nor of
that of Anacreon; and he showed that he differed in some respects from
the account that had been given by Menodotus.</p>

<p>But one may explain this fact of the osier garlands more simply, by
saying that Megisthes wore a garland of osier because there was a
great quantity of those trees in the place where he was feasting; and
therefore he used it to bind his temples. For the Lacedæmonians at the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1076]</span>

festival of the Promachia, wear garlands of reeds, as Sosibius tells
us in his treatise on the Sacrificial Festivals at Lacedæmon, where
he writes thus: "On this festival the natives of the country all wear
garlands of reeds, or tiaras, but the boys who have been brought up in
the public school follow without any garland at all."</p>

<p>16. But Aristotle, in the second book of his treatise on Love Affairs,
and Ariston the Peripatetic, who was a native of Ceos, in the second
book of his Amatory Resemblances, say that "The ancients, on account of
the headaches which were produced by their wine-drinking, adopted the
practice of wearing garlands made of anything which came to hand, as
the binding the head tight appeared to be of service to them. But men
in later times added also some ornaments to their temples, which had a
kind of reference to their employment of drinking, and so they invented
garlands in the present fashion. But it is more reasonable to suppose
that it was because the head is the seat of all sensation that men
wore crowns upon it, than that they did so because it was desirable to
have their temples shaded and bound as a remedy against the headaches
produced by wine."</p>

<p>They also wore garlands over their foreheads, as the sweet Anacreon
says&mdash;</p>

  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>They also wore garlands on their breasts, and anointed them with
perfume, because that is the seat of the heart. And they call the
garlands which they put round their necks ὑποθυμιάδες, as
Alcæus does in these lines&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse">From great Prometheus.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>But Sappho gives a more simple reason for our wearing garlands,
speaking as follows&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">But place those garlands on thy lovely hair,</div>
    <div class="verse">Twining the tender sprouts of anise green</div>
    <div class="verse">With skilful hand; for offerings of flowers</div>
    <div class="verse">Are pleasing to the gods, who hate all those</div>
    <div class="verse">Who come before them with uncrownèd heads.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>In which lines she enjoins all who offer sacrifice to wear garlands on
their heads, as they are beautiful things, and acceptable to the Gods.
Aristotle also, in his Banquet, says, "We never offer any mutilated
gift to the Gods, but only such as are perfect and entire; and what
is full is entire, and crowning anything indicates filling it in some
sort. So Homer says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">The slaves the goblets crown'd with rosy wine;<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></div>

  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And in another place he says&mdash;</p>

  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>That is to say, eloquence in speaking makes up in the case of some men
for their personal ugliness. Now this is what the στέφανος
seems intended to do, on which account, in times of mourning, we do
exactly the contrary. For wishing to testify our sympathy for the dead,
we mutilate ourselves by cutting our hair, and by putting aside our
garlands."</p>

<p>17. Now Philonides the physician, in his treatise on Ointments and
Garlands, says, "After the vine was introduced into Greece from the Red
Sea, and when most people had become addicted to intemperate enjoyment,
and had learnt to drink unmixed wine, some of them became quite frantic
and out of their minds, while others got so stupified as to resemble
the dead. And once, when some men were drinking on the sea-shore, a
violent shower came on, and broke up the party, and filled the goblet,
which had a little wine left in it, with water. But when it became fine
again, the men returned to the same spot, and tasting the new mixture,
found that their enjoyment was now not only exquisite, but free from
any subsequent pain. And on this account, the Greeks

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1078]</span>

invoke the good Deity at the cup of unmixed wine, which is served
round to them at dinner, paying honour to the Deity who invented wine;
and that was Bacchus. But when the first cup of mixed wine is handed
round after dinner, they then invoke Jupiter the Saviour, thinking him
the cause of this mixture of wine which is so unattended with pain,
as being the author of rain. Now, those who suffered in their heads
after drinking, certainly stood in need of some remedy; and so the
binding their heads was what most readily occurred to them, as Nature
herself led them to this remedy. For a certain man having a headache,
as Andreas says, pressed his head, and found relief, and so invented a
ligature as a remedy for headache.</p>

<p>Accordingly, men using these ligatures as assistants in drinking, used
to bind their heads with whatever came in their way. And first of all,
they took garlands of ivy, which offered itself, as it were, of its own
accord, and was very plentiful, and grew everywhere, and was pleasant
to look upon, shading the forehead with its green leaves and bunches of
berries, and bearing a good deal of tension, so as to admit of being
bound tight across the brow, and imparting also a certain degree of
coolness without any stupifying smell accompanying it. And it seems to
me that this is the reason why men have agreed to consider the garland
of ivy sacred to Bacchus, implying by this that the inventor of wine
is also the defender of men from all the inconveniences which arise
from the use of it. And from thence, regarding chiefly pleasure, and
considering utility and the comfort of the relief from the effects
of drunkenness of less importance, they were influenced chiefly by
what was agreeable to the sight or to the smell. And therefore they
adopted crowns of myrtle, which has exciting properties, and which also
represses any rising of the fumes of wine; and garlands of roses, which
to a certain extent relieve headache, and also impart some degree of
coolness; and garlands also of bay leaves, which they think are not
wholly unconnected with drinking parties. But garlands of white lilies,
which have an effect on the head, and wreaths of amaracus, or of any
other flower or herb which has any tendency to produce heaviness or
torpid feelings in the head, must be avoided."</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">GARLANDS.</div>

<p>And Apollodorus, in his treatise on Perfumes and Garlands,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1079]</span>

has said the same thing in the very same words. And this, my friends,
is enough to say on this subject.</p>

<p>18. But concerning the Naucratite Crown, and what kind of flowers
that is made of, I made many investigations, and inquired a great
deal without learning anything, till at last I fell in with a book
of Polycharmus of Naucratis, entitled On Venus, in which I found the
following passage:&mdash;"But in the twenty-third Olympiad Herostratus, a
fellow-countryman of mine, who was a merchant, and as such had sailed
to a great many different countries, coming by chance to Paphos,
in Cyprus, bought an image of Venus, a span high, of very ancient
workmanship, and came away meaning to bring it to Naucratis. And as
he was sailing near the Egyptian coast, a violent storm suddenly
overtook him, and the sailors could not tell where they were, and so
they all had recourse to this image of Venus, entreating her to save
them. And the goddess, for she was kindly disposed towards the men of
Naucratis, on a sudden filled all the space near her with branches
of green myrtle, and diffused a most delicious odour over the whole
ship, when all the sailors had previously despaired of safety from
their violent sea-sickness. And after they had been all very sick, the
sun shone out, and they, seeing the landmarks, came in safety into
Naucratis. And Herostratus having disembarked from the ship with his
image, and carrying with him also the green branches of myrtle which
had so suddenly appeared to him, consecrated it and them in the temple
of Venus. And having sacrificed to the goddess, and having consecrated
the image to Venus, and invited all his relations and most intimate
friends to a banquet in the temple, he gave every one of them a garland
of these branches of myrtle, to which garlands he then gave the name
of Naucratite." This is the account given by Polycharmus; and I myself
believe the statement, and believe that the Naucratite garland is
no other than one made of myrtle, especially as in Anacreon it is
represented as worn with one made of roses. And Philonides has said
that the garland made of myrtle acts as a check upon the fumes of wine,
and that the one made of roses, in addition to its cooking qualities,
is to a certain extent a remedy for headache. And, therefore, those men
are only to be laughed at, who say that the Naucratite garland is the
wreath made of what is called by the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1080]</span>

Egyptians biblus, quoting the statement of Theopompus, in the third
book of his History of Greece, where he says, "That when Agesilaus the
Lacedæmonian arrived in Egypt, the Egyptians sent him many presents,
and among them the papyrus, which is used for making garlands." But
I do not know what pleasure or advantage there could be in having a
crown made of biblus with roses, unless people who are enamoured of
such a wreath as this should also take a fancy to wear crowns of garlic
and roses together. But I know that a great many people say that the
garland made of the sampsychon or amaracus is the Naucratite garland;
and this plant is very plentiful in Egypt, but the myrtle in Egypt is
superior in sweetness to that which is found in any other country, as
Theophrastus relates in another place.</p>

<p>19. While this discussion was going on, some slaves came in bringing
garlands made of such flowers as were in bloom at the time; and
Myrtilus said;&mdash;Tell me, my good friend Ulpian, the different names of

<p>And he, laughing, replied,&mdash;The word στέφανος was first used
among the Greeks, as Semos the Delian tells us in the fourth book of
his Delias, in the same sense as the word στέφος is used by
us, which, however, by some people is called στέμμα. On which
account, being first crowned with this στέφανος, afterwards
we put on a garland of bay leaves; and the word στέφανος
itself is derived from the verb στέφω, to crown. But do you,
you loquacious Thessalian, think, says he, that I am going to repeat
any of those old and hacknied stories? But

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1081]</span>

because of your tongue (γλῶσσα), I will mention the

<p>And Theodorus, in his Attic Words, as Pamphilus says in his treatise

<p>21. But since I have mentioned Alexandria, I know that in that
beautiful city there is a garland called the garland of Antinous,
which is made of the lotus, which grows in those parts. And this lotus
grows in the marshes in the summer season; and it bears flowers of
two colours; one like that of the rose, and it is the garlands woven
of the flowers of this colour which are properly called the garlands
of Antinous; but the other kind is called the lotus garland, being
of a dark colour. And a man of the name of Pancrates, a native poet,
with whom we ourselves were acquainted, made a great parade of showing
a rose-coloured lotus to Adrian the emperor, when he was staying at
Alexandria, saying, that

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1082]</span>

he ought to give this flower the name of the Flower of Antinous, as
having sprung from the ground where it drank in the blood of the
Mauritanian lion, which Hadrian killed when he was out hunting in
that part of Africa, near Alexandria; a monstrous beast which had
ravaged all Libya for a long time, so as to make a very great part of
the district desolate. Accordingly, Hadrian being delighted with the
utility of the invention, and also with its novelty, granted to the
poet that he should be maintained for the future in the Museum at the
public expense; and Cratinus the comic poet, in his Ulysseses, has
called the lotus στεφάνωμα, because all plants which are
full of leaf, are called στεφανώματα by the Athenians. But
Pancrates said, with a good deal of neatness, in his poem&mdash;</p>

<p>22. There is the word πυλέων. And this is the name given to
the garland which the Lacedæmonians place on the head of Juno, as
Pamphilus relates.</p>

<p>I am aware, also, that there is a kind of garland, which is called
Ἰάκχας by the Sicyonians, as Timachidas mentions in his
treatise on Dialects. And Philetas writes as follows:&mdash;"Ἰάκχα
&mdash;this is a name given to a fragrant garland in the district of
Sicyon&mdash;</p>

  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Seleucus also, in his treatise on Dialects, says, that there is a kind
of garland made of myrtle, which is called Ἐλλωτὶς, being
twenty cubits in circumference, and that it is carried in procession
on the festival of the Ellotia. And he says, that in this garland the
bones of Europa, whom they call Ellotis, are carried. And this festival
of the Ellotia is celebrated in Corinth.</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">GARLANDS.</div>

<p>There is also the Θυρεατικός. This also is
a name given to a species of garland by the Lacedæmonians, as Sosibius
tells us in his treatise on Sacrifices, where he says, that now it is called
ψίλινος, being made of branches of the palm-tree.
And he says that they are worn, as a memorial of the victory which they gained, in
Thyrea,<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
by the leaders of the choruses,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1083]</span>

which are employed in that festival when they celebrate the
Gymnopædiæ.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a
href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> And there are choruses,
some of handsome boys, and others of full-grown men of distinguished
bravery, who all dance naked, and who sing the songs of Thaletas and
Alcman, and the pæans of Dionysodotus the Lacedæmonian.</p>

<p>There are also garlands called μελιλώτινοι, which are
mentioned by Alexis in his Crateva, or the Apothecary, in the following
line&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">And many μελιλώτινοι garlands hanging.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>There is the word too, ἐπιθυμίδες, which Seleucus explains by
"every sort of garland." But Timachidas says, "Garlands of every kind
which are worn by women are called ἐπιθυμίδες."</p>

<p>There are also the words ὑποθυμὶς and ὑποθυμιὰς,
which are names given to garlands by the Æolians and Ionians, and they
wear such around their necks, as one may clearly collect from the
poetry of Alcæus and Anacreon. But Philetas, in his Miscellanies, says,
that the Lesbians call a branch of myrtle ὑποθυμὶς, around
which they twine violets and other flowers.</p>

<p>The ὑπογλωττὶς also is a species of garland. But Theodorus,
in his Attic Words, says, that it is a particular kind of garland,
and is used in that sense by Plato the comic poet, in his Jupiter
Ill-treated.</p>

<p>23. I find also, in the comic poets, mention made of a kind of garland
called κυλιστὸς, and I find that Archippus mentions it in his
Rhinon, in these lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And Alexis, in his Agonis, or The Colt, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">This third man has a κυλιστὸς garland</div>

<p>and in his Sciron he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 1084]</span></p>

<p>Antiphanes also mentions it in his Man in Love with Himself. And
Eubulus, in his Œnomaus, or Pelops, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse">Like a κυλιστὸς garland.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>What, then, is this κυλιστός? For I am aware that Nicander of
Thyatira, in his Attic Nouns, speaks as follows,&mdash;"Ἐκκυλίσιοι στέφανοι,
and especially those made of roses." And now I ask what
species of garland this was, O Cynulcus; and do not tell me that I am
to understand the word as meaning merely large. For you are a man who
are fond of not only picking things little known out of books, but
of even digging out such matters; like the philosophers in the Joint
Deceiver of Baton the comic poet; men whom Sophocles also mentions in
his Fellow Feasters, and who resemble you,&mdash;</p>

<p>Since, then, you are sated not only with the heads of glaucus, but
also with that evergreen herb, which that Anthedonian Deity<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
ate, and became immortal, give us an answer now about the subject of
discussion, that we may not think that when you are dead, you will be
metamorphosed, as the divine Plato has described in his treatise on
the Soul. For he says that those who are addicted to gluttony, and
insolence, and drunkenness, and who are restrained by no modesty,
may naturally become transformed into the race of asses, and similar
animals.</p>

<p>24. And as he still appeared to be in doubt;&mdash;Let us now, said
Ulpian, go on to another kind of garland, which is called the
στρούθιος; which Asclepiades mentions when he
quotes the following passage, out of the Female Garland-Sellers of Eubulus&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">O happy woman, in your little house</div>

   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote-left">GARLANDS.</div>

<p>And this garland is made of the flower called στρούθιον
(soap-wort), which is mentioned by Theophrastus, in the sixth

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1085]</span>

book of his Natural History, in these words&mdash;"The iris also blooms in
the summer, and so does the flower called στρούθιον, which
is a very pretty flower to the eye, but destitute of scent." Galene
of Smyrna also speaks of the same flower, under the name of στρύθιον.</p>

<p>There is also the πόθος. There is a certain kind of garland
with this name, as Nicander the Colophonian tells us in his treatise on
Words. And this, too, perhaps is so named as being made of the flower
called πόθος, which the same Theophrastus mentions in the
sixth book of his Natural History, where he writes thus&mdash;"There are
other flowers which bloom chiefly in the summer,&mdash;the lychnis, the
flower of Jove, the lily, the iphyum, the Phrygian amaracus, and also
the plant called pothus, of which there are two kinds, one bearing a
flower like the hyacinth, but the other produces a colourless blossom
nearly white, which men use to strew on tombs.</p>

<p>Eubulus also gives a list of other names of garlands&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse">Ægidion, carry now this garland for me,</div>

<p>25. There is the philyrinus also. Xenarchus, in his Soldier, says&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse">Of delicate leafy linden (φιλύρα).</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Some garlands also are called ἑλικτοὶ, as they are even to
this day among the Alexandrians. And Chæremon the tragic poet mentions
them in his Bacchus, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">The triple folds of the ἑλικτοὶ garlands,</div>

</div>

<p>But concerning the evergreen garlands in Egypt, Hellanicus, in his
History of Egypt, writes as follows&mdash;"There is a city on the banks
of the river, named Tindium. This is a place where many gods are
assembled, and in the middle of the city there is a sacred temple of
great size made of marble, and the doors are marble. And within the
temple there are white and black thorns, on which garlands were placed

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1086]</span>

made of the flower of the acanthus, and also of the blossoms of the
pomegranate, and of vine-leaves. And these keep green for ever. These
garlands were placed by the gods themselves in Egypt when they heard
that Babys was king, (and he is the same who is also called Typhon.)"
But Demetrius, in his History of the Things to be seen in Egypt,
says that these thorns grow about the city of Abydos, and he writes
thus&mdash;"But the lower district has a tree called the thorn, which bears
a round fruit on some round-shaped branches. And this tree blooms at
a certain season; and the flower is very beautiful and brilliant in
colour. And there is a story told by the Egyptians, that the Æthiopians
who had been sent as allies to Troy by Tithonus, when they heard that
Memnon was slain, threw down on the spot all their garlands on the
thorns. And the branches themselves on which the flower grows resemble
garlands." And the before-mentioned Hellanicus mentions also that
Amasis, who was king of Egypt, was originally a private individual of
the class of the common people; and that it was owing to the present
of a garland, which he made of the most beautiful flowers that were in
season, and sent to Patarmis, who was king of Egypt, at the time when
he was celebrating the festival of his birthday, that he afterwards
became king himself. For Patarmis, being delighted at the beauty of the
garland, invited Amasis to supper, and after this treated him as one
of his friends; and on one occasion sent him out as his general, when
the Egyptians were making war upon him. And he was made king by these
Egyptians out of their hatred to Patarmis.</p>

<p>26. There are also garlands called συνθηματιαῖοι,
which people make and furnish by contract. Aristophanes, in his
Thesmophoriazusæ, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">To make up twenty συνθηματιαῖοι garlands.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>We find also the word χορωνόν. Apion, in his treatise on
the Roman Dialect, says that formerly a garland was called χορωνόν, from the fact of the members of the chorus in the theatres
using it; and that they wore garlands and contended for garlands. And
one may see this name given to garlands in the Epigrams of Simonides&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 1087]</span></p>

   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>There are ἀκίνιοι too. There are some garlands made of the
basil thyme (ἄκινος) which are called by this name, as we are
told by Andron the physician, whose words are quoted by Parthenius the
pupil of Dionysius, in the first book of his treatise on the Words
which occur in the Historians.</p>

<p>27. Now Theophrastus gives the following list of flowers as suitable to
be made into garlands&mdash;"The violet, the flower of Jupiter, the iphyum,
the wallflower, the hemerocalles, or yellow lily. But he says the
earliest blooming flower is the white violet; and about the same time
that which is called the wild wallflower appears, and after them the
narcissus and the lily; and of mountain flowers, that kind of anemone
which is called the mountain anemone, and the head of the bulb-plant.
For some people twine these flowers into garlands. And next to these
there comes the œnanthe and the purple violet. And of wild flowers,
there are the helichryse, and that species of anemone called the
meadow anemone, and the gladiolus, and the hyacinth. But the rose is
the latest blooming flower of all; and it is the latest to appear and
the first to go off. But the chief summer flowers are the lychnis, and
the flower of Jupiter, and the lily, and the iphyum, and the Phrygian
amaracus, and also the flower called the pothus." And in his ninth
book the same Theophrastus says, if any one wears a garland made of
the flower of the helichryse, he is praised if he sprinkle it with
ointment. And Alcman mentions it in these lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">And I pray to you, and bring</div>

  </div>

    <div class="verse">And hyacinths, and helichryse.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>But the helichryse is a flower like the lotus. And Themistagoras the
Ephesian, in his book entitled The Golden Book, says that the flower
derives its name from the nymph who first picked it, who was called

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1088]</span>

Helichrysa. There are also, says Theophrastus, such flowers as purple
lilies. But Philinus says that the lily, which he calls κρίνον,
is by some people called λείριον, and by others
ἴον. The Corinthians also call this flower ambrosia, as
Nicander says in his Dictionary. And Diocles, in his treatise on Deadly
Poisons, says&mdash;"The amaracus, which some people call the sampsychus."</p>

<p>28. Cratinus also speaks of the hyacinth by the name of κοσμοσάνδαλον in his Effeminate People, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">

   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And Clearchus, in the second book of his Lives, says&mdash;"You may remark
the Lacedæmonians who, having invented garlands of cosmosandalum,
trampled under foot the most ancient system of polity in the world, and
utterly ruined themselves; on which account Antiphanes the comic poet
very cleverly says of them, in his Harp-player&mdash;</p>

   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And Hicesius, in the second book of his treatise on Matter, says&mdash;"The
white violet is of moderately astringent properties, and has a most
delicious fragrance, and is very delightful, but only for a short time;
and the purple violet is of the same appearance, but it is far more
fragrant." And Apollodorus, in his treatise on Beasts, says&mdash;"There
is the chamæpitys, or ground pine, which some call olocyrum, but the
Athenians call it Ionia, and the Eubœans sideritis." And Nicander, in
the second book of his Georgics, (the words themselves I will quote
hereafter, when I thoroughly discuss all the flowers fit for making
into garlands,) says&mdash;"The violet (ἴον) was originally given
by some Ionian nymphs to Ion."</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">GARLANDS.</div>

<p>And in the sixth book of his History of Plants, Theophrastus says
that the narcissus is also called λείριον; but in a subsequent
passage he speaks of the narcissus and λείριον as different
plants. And Eumachus the Corcyrean, in his treatise on Cutting Roots,
says that the narcissus is also called acacallis, and likewise
crotalum. But the flower called hemerocalles, or day-beauty, which
fades at night but blooms

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1089]</span>

at sunrise, is mentioned by Cratinus in his Effeminate People, where he
says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">And the dear hemerocalles.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Concerning the ground thyme, Theophrastus says&mdash;"The people gather the
wild ground thyme on the mountains and plant it around Sicyon, and the
Athenians gather it on Hymettus; and other nations too have mountains
full of this flower, as the Thracians for instance." But Philinus
says that it is called zygis. And Amerias the Macedonian, speaking of
the lychnis in his treatise on Cutting up Roots, says that "it sprang
from the baths of Venus, when Venus bathed after having been sleeping
with Vulcan. And it is found in the greatest perfection in Cyprus and
Lemnos, and also in Stromboli and near mount Eryx, and at Cythera."</p>

<p>"But the iris," says Theophrastus, "blooms in the summer, and is the
only one of all the European flowers which has a sweet scent. And it
is in the highest beauty in those parts of Illyricum which are at a
distance from the sea." But Philinus says that the flowers of the iris
are called λύκοι, because they resemble the lips of the wolf
(λύκος). And Nicolaus of Damascus, in the hundred and eighth
book of his History, says that there is a lake near the Alps, many
stadia in circumference, round which there grow every year the most
fragrant and beautiful flowers, like those which are called calchæ.
Alcman also mentions the calchæ in these lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">Having a golden-colour'd necklace on</div>
    <div class="verse">Of the bright calchæ, with their tender petals.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And Epicharmus, too, speaks of them in his Rustic.</p>

<p>29. Of roses, says Theophrastus in his sixth book, there are many
varieties. For most of them consist only of five leaves, but some
have twelve leaves; and some, near Philippi, have even as many as a
hundred leaves. For men take up the plants from Mount Pangæum, (and
they are very numerous there,) and plant them near the city. And the
inner petals are very small; for the fashion in which the flowers put
out their petals is, that some form the outer rows and some the inner
ones: but they have not much smell, nor are they of any great size.
And those with only five leaves are the most fragrant, and their lower
parts are very thorny. But the most fragrant roses are in Cyrene: on
which account the perfumes made there are the sweetest. And in this

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1090]</span>

country, too, the perfume of the violets, and of all other flowers, is
most pure and heavenly; and above all, the fragrance of the crocus is
most delicious in those parts." And Timachidas, in his Banquets, says
that the Arcadians call the rose εὐόμφαλον,
meaning εὔοσμον, or fragrant. And Apollodorus, in the fourth book of his
History of Parthia, speaks of a flower called philadelphum, as growing
in the country of the Parthians, and describes it thus:&mdash;"And there
are many kinds of myrtle,&mdash;the milax, and that which is called the
philadelphum, which has received a name corresponding to its natural
character; for when branches, which are at a distance from one another,
meet together of their own accord, they cohere with a vigorous embrace,
and become united as if they came from one root, and then growing on,
they produce fresh shoots: on which account they often make hedges
of them in well-cultivated farms; for they take the thinnest of the
shoots, and plait them in a net-like manner, and plant them all round
their gardens, and then these plants, when plaited together all round,
make a fence which it is difficult to pass through."</p>

<p>30. The author, too, of the Cyprian Poems gives lists of the flowers
which are suitable to be made into garlands, whether he was Hegesias,
or Stasinus, or any one else; for Demodamas, who was either a
Halicarnassian or Milesian, in his History of Halicarnassus, says that
the Cyprian Poems were the work of a citizen of Halicarnassus: however,
the author, whoever he was, in his eleventh book, speaks thus:&mdash;</p>

flower from the anemone (for some people have called them the same).
But Theophrastus says that there are some plants, the flowers of which
constantly follow the stars, such as the one called the heliotrope, and
the chelidonium; and this last plant is named so from its coming into
bloom at the same time as the swallows arrive. There is also a flower
spoken of under the name of ambrosia by Carystius, in his Historical
Commentaries, where he says&mdash;"Nicander says that the plant named
ambrosia grows at Cos, on the head of the statue of Alexander." But I
have already spoken of it, and mentioned that some people give this
name to the lily. And Timachidas, in the fourth book of his Banquet,
speaks also of a flower called theseum,&mdash;</p>

<p>But you may go on gorging yourself, O Cynulcus; and when you have

<p>34. And while the slaves were bringing round perfumes in alabaster
boxes, and in other vessels made of gold, some one, seeing Cynulcus,
anointed his face with a great deal of ointment. But he, being awakened
by it, when he recollected himself, said;&mdash;What is this? O Hercules,
will not some one come with a sponge and wipe my face, which is
thus polluted with a lot of dirt? And do not you all know that that
exquisite writer Xenophon, in his Banquet, represents Socrates as
speaking thus:&mdash;"'By Jupiter! O Callias, you entertain us superbly;
for you have not only given us a most faultless feast, but you have
furnished us also with delicious food for our eyes and ears.'&mdash;'Well,
then,' said he, 'suppose any one were to bring us perfumes, in order
that we might also banquet on sweet smells?'&mdash;'By no means,' said
Socrates; 'for as there is one sort of dress fit for women and another
for men, so there is one kind of smell fit for women and another for
men. And no man is ever anointed with perfume for the sake of men; and
as to women, especially when they are brides,&mdash;as, for instance, the
bride of this Niceratus here, and the bride of Critobulus,&mdash;how can
they want perfumes in their husbands, when they themselves are redolent
of it? But the smell of the oil in the gymnasia, when it is present, is
sweeter than perfume to women; and when it is absent, they long more
for it. For if a slave and a freeman be anointed with perfume, they
both smell alike in a moment; but those smells which are derived from
free labours, require both virtuous habits and a good deal of time
if they are to be agreeable and in character with a freeman.'" And

that admirable writer Chrysippus says that perfumes (μύρα)
derive their name from being prepared with great toil (μόρος)
and useless labour. The Lacedæmonians even expel from Sparta those
who make perfumes, as being wasters of oil; and those who dye wool,
as being destroyers of the whiteness of the wool. And Solon the
philosopher, in his laws, forbade men to be sellers of perfumes.</p>

<p>35. "But now, not only scents," as Clearchus says in the third book of
his Lives, "but also dyes, being full of luxury, tend to make those
men effeminate who have anything to do with them. And do you think
that effeminacy without virtue has anything desirable in it? But even
Sappho, a thorough woman, and a poetess into the bargain, was ashamed
to separate honour from elegance; and speaks thus&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse">But elegance I truly love;</div>

   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>making it evident to everybody that the desire of life that she
confessed had respectability and honour in it; and these things
especially belong to virtue. But Parrhasius the painter, although he
was a man beyond all measure arrogant about his art, and though he got
the credit of a liberal profession by some mere pencils and pallets,
still in words set up a claim to virtue, and put this inscription on
all his works that are at Lindus:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse">A most luxurious (ἁβροδίαιτος) and virtuous man.</div>

 </div>
</div>

<p>And a wit being indignant at this, because, I suppose, he seemed to be
a disgrace to the delicacy and beauty of virtue, having perverted the
gifts which fortune had bestowed upon him to luxury, proposed to change
the inscription into ῥαβδοδίαιτος ἀνήρ: Still, said he, the
man must be endured, since he says that he honours virtue." These are
the words of Clearchus. But Sophocles the poet, in his play called The
Judgment, represents Venus, being a sort of Goddess of Pleasure, as
anointed with perfumes, and looking in a glass; but Minerva, as being a
sort of Goddess of Intellect and Mind, and also of Virtue, as using oil
and gymnastic exercises.</p>

<p>36. In reply to this, Masurius said;&mdash;But, my most excellent friend,
are you not aware that it is in our brain that our senses are soothed,
and indeed reinvigorated, by sweet smells? as Alexis says in his

</div>
<p>for he recommends anointing the breast with unguent, as being the seat
of the heart, and considering it an admitted point that that is soothed
with fragrant smells. And the ancients used to act thus, not only
because scents do of their own nature ascend upwards from the breast
to the seat of smelling, but also because they thought that the soul
had its abode in the heart; as Praxagoras, and Philotimus the physician
taught; and Homer, too, says&mdash;</p>

<p>And Plato says, "that the great Architect of the universe has placed
the lungs close to the heart, by nature soft and destitute of blood,
and having cavities penetrable like sponge, that so the heart, when
it quivers, from fear of adversity or disaster, may vibrate against
a soft and yielding substance." But the garlands with which men bind
their bosoms are called ὑποθυμιάδες by the poets, from the
exhalations (ἀναθυμίασις) of the flowers, and not because the
soul (ψυχὴ) is called θυμὸς, as some people think.</p>

<p>37. Archilochus is the earliest author who uses the word μύρον
(perfume), where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">She being old would spare her perfumes (μύρα).</div>

    <div class="verse">Displaying hair and breast perfumed (ἐσμυρισμένον);</div>
    <div class="verse">So that a man, though old, might fall in love with her.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And the word μύρον is derived from μύῤῥα, which is
the Æolic form of σμύρνα (myrrh); for the greater portion
of unguents are made up with myrrh, and that which is called στακτὴ is
wholly composed of it. Not but what Homer was acquainted
with the fashion of using unguents and perfumes, but he calls them
ἔλαια, with the addition of some distinctive epithet, as&mdash;</p>

<p>38. But the choicest unguents are made in particular places, as
Apollonius of Herophila says in his treatise on Perfumes, where he
writes&mdash;"The iris is best in Elis, and at Cyzicus; the perfume made
from roses is most excellent at Phaselis, and that made at Naples and
Capua is also very fine. That made from crocuses is in the highest
perfection at

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1100]</span>

Soli in Cilicia, and at Rhodes. The essence of spikenard is best at
Tarsus; and the extract of vine-leaves is made best in Cyprus and at
Adramyttium. The best perfume from marjoram and from apples comes
from Cos. Egypt bears the palm for its essence of cypirus; and the
next best is the Cyprian, and Phœnician, and after them comes the
Sidonian. The perfume called Panathenaicum is made at Athens; and those
called Metopian and Mendesian are prepared with the greatest skill in
Egypt. But the Metopian is made of oil which is extracted from bitter
almonds. Still, the superior excellence of each perfume is owing to
the purveyors and the materials and the artists, and not to the place
itself; for Ephesus formerly, as men say, had a high reputation for the
excellence of its perfumes, and especially of its megallium, but now
it has none. At one time, too, the unguents made in Alexandria were
brought to high perfection, on account of the wealth of the city, and
the attention that Arsinoe and Berenice paid to such matters; and the
finest extract of roses in the world was made at Cyrene while the great
Berenice was alive. Again, in ancient times, the extract of vine-leaves
made at Adramyttium was but poor; but afterwards it became first-rate,
owing to Stratonice, the wife of Eumenes. Formerly, too, Syria used to
make every sort of unguent admirably, especially that extracted from
fenugreek; but the case is quite altered now. And long ago there used
to be a most delicious unguent extracted from frankincense at Pergamus,
owing to the invention of a certain perfumer of that city, for no one
else had ever made it before him; but now none is made there.</p>

<p>"Now, when a valuable unguent is poured on the top of one that is
inferior, it remains on the surface; but when good honey is poured on
the top of that which is inferior, it works its way to the bottom, for
it compels that which is worse to rise above it."</p>

<p>"And perhaps," says Didymus, "he means in this passage that which is
called στακτὴ, on account of the myrrh which is brought to
Egypt, and from thence imported into Greece."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 1101]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">PERFUMES.</div>

<p>And Hicesius says, in the second book of his treatise on Matter,&mdash;"Of
perfumes, some are rubbed on, and some are poured on. Now, the perfume
made from roses is suitable for drinking parties, and so is that made
from myrtles and from apples; and this last is good for the stomach,
and useful for lethargic people. That made from vine-leaves is good
for the stomach, and has also the effect of keeping the mind clear.
Those extracted from sampsychum and ground thyme are also well suited
to drinking parties; and so is that extract of crocus which is not
mixed with any great quantity of myrrh. The στακτὴ, also, is
well suited for drinking parties; and so is the spikenard: that made
from fenugreek is sweet and tender; while that which comes from white
violets is fragrant, and very good for the digestion."</p>

<p>Theophrastus, also, in his treatise on Scents, says, "that some
perfumes are made of flowers; as, for instance, from roses, and white
violets, and lilies, which last is called σούσινον. There
are also those which are extracted from mint and ground thyme, and
gopper, and the crocus; of which the best is procured in Ægina and
Cilicia. Some, again, are made of leaves, as those made from myrrh and
the œnanthe; and the wild vine grows in Cyprus, on the mountains, and
is very plentiful; but no perfume is made of that which is found in
Greece, because that has no scent. Some perfumes, again, are extracted
from roots; as is that made from the iris, and from spikenard, and from
marjoram, and from zedoary."</p>

<p>40. Now, that the ancients were very much addicted to the use of
perfumes, is plain from their knowing to which of our limbs each

<p>And when he speaks of Sardian ornaments, he means to include perfumes;
since the Lydians were very notorious for their luxury. And so Anacreon
uses the word Λυδοπαθὴς (Lydian-like) as equivalent to
ἡδυπαθὴς (luxurious). Sophocles also uses the word

name was Megallus. But some say that Megallus was an Athenian: and
Aristophanes mentions him in his Telmissians, and so does Pherecrates
in his Petale; and Strattis, in his Medea, speaks thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>There was also an unguent called sagda, which is mentioned by Eupolis
in his Coraliscus, where he writes&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">And baccaris, and sagda too.</div>

</div>

<p>which expression Nicander of Thyatira understands to be meant as an
attack upon a man who is too much devoted to luxury. But Theodoras
says, that sagda is a species of spice used in fumigation.</p>

<p>44. Now a cotyla of unguent used to be sold for a high price at Athens,
even, as Hipparchus says in his Nocturnal Festival, for as much as
five minæ; but as Menander, in his Misogynist, states, for ten. And
Antiphanes, in his Phrearrus, where he is speaking of the unguent
called stacte, says&mdash;</p>

<p>but the Athenians also, who have always been the leaders of every
refinement and luxury in human life, used them very

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1105]</span>

much; so that among them, as has been already mentioned, they used to
fetch an enormous price; but, nevertheless, they did not abstain from
the use of them on that account; just as we now do not deny ourselves
scents which are so expensive and exquisite that those things are mere
trifles which are spoken of in the Settler of Alexis&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">For he did use no alabaster box</div>
    <div class="verse">From which t'anoint himself; for this is but</div>
    <div class="verse">An ordinary, and quite old-fashion'd thing.</div>

    <div class="verse">Envy me not, ye noble chiefs of Greece;</div>
    <div class="verse">For thus, while sacrificing, I myself</div>
    <div class="verse">Was sprinkled o'er with unguent of the iris.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>45. Just think, in God's name, my friends, what luxury, or I should
rather say, what profuse waste it was to have one's garments sprinkled
in this manner, when a man might have taken up a little unguent in
his hands, as we do now, and in that manner have anointed his whole
body, and especially his head. For Myronides says, in his treatise
on Unguents and Garlands, that "the fashion of anointing the head at
banquets arose from this:&mdash;that those men whose heads are naturally
dry, find the humours which are engendered by what they eat, rise up
into their heads; and on this account, as their bodies are inflamed
by fevers, they bedew their heads with lotions, so as to prevent
the neighbouring humours from rising into a part which is dry, and
which also has a considerable vacuum in it. And so at their banquets,
having consideration for this fact, and being afraid of the strength
of the wine rising into their heads, men have introduced the fashion
of anointing their heads, and by these means the wine, they think,
will have less effect upon them, if they make their head thoroughly
wet first. And as men are never content with what is merely useful,
but are always desirous to add to that whatever tends to pleasure and
enjoyment; in that way they have been led to adopt the use of unguents."</p>

<p>We ought, therefore, my good cynic Theodorus, to use at banquets
those unguents which have the least tendency to produce heaviness,
and to employ those which have astringent

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1106]</span>

or cooling properties very sparingly. But Aristotle, that man of most
varied learning, raises the question, "Why men who use unguents are
more grey than others? Is it because unguents have drying properties
by reason of the spices used in their composition, so that they who
use them become dry, and the dryness produces greyness? For whether
greyness arises from a drying of the hair, or from a want of natural
heat, at all events dryness has a withering effect. And it is on this
account too that the use of hats makes men grey more quickly; for by
them the moisture which ought to nourish the hair is taken away."</p>

<p>46. But when I was reading the twenty-eighth book of the History of
Posidonius, I observed, my friends, a very pleasant thing which was
said about unguents, and which is not at all foreign to our present
discussion. For the philosopher says&mdash;"In Syria, at the royal banquets,
when the garlands are given to the guests, some slaves come in, having
little bladders full of Babylonian perfumes, and going round the room
at a little distance from the guests, they bedew their garlands with
the perfumes, sprinkling nothing else." And since the discussion has
brought us to this point, I will add</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse">A verse to Love,</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>as the bard of Cythera says, telling you that Janus, who is worshipped
as a great god by us, and whom we call Janus Pater, was the original
inventor of garlands. And Dracon of Corcyra tells us this in his
treatise on Precious Stones, where his words are&mdash;"But it is said that
Janus had two faces, the one looking forwards and the other backwards;
and that it is from him that the mountain Janus and the river Janus are
both named, because he used to live on the mountain. And they say that
he was the first inventor of garlands, and boats, and ships; and was
also the first person who coined brazen money. And on this account many
cities in Greece, and many in Italy and Sicily, place on their coins
a head with two faces, and on the obverse a boat, or a garland, or a
ship. And they say that he married his sister Camise, and had a son
named Æthax, and a daughter Olistene. And he, aiming at a more extended
power and renown, sailed over to Italy, and settled on a mountain near
Rome, which was called Janiculum from his name."</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">LIBATIONS.</div>

<p>47. This, now, is what was said about perfumes and some unguents.
And after this most of them asked for wine,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1107]</span>

some demanding the Cup of the Good Deity, others that of Health, and
different people invoking different deities; and so they all fell to
quoting the words of those poets who had mentioned libations to these
different deities; and I will now recapitulate what they said, for they
quoted Antiphanes, who, in his Clowns, says&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>48. And Theophrastus, in his essay on Drunkenness, says&mdash;"The unmixed
wine which is given at a banquet, which they call the pledge-cup
in honour of the Good Deity, they offer in small quantities, as if
reminding the guests of its strength,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1108]</span>

and of the liberality of the god, by the mere taste. And they hand it
round when men are already full, in order that there may be as little
as possible drunk out of it. And having paid adoration three times,
they take it from the table, as if they were entreating of the gods
that nothing may be done unbecomingly, and that they may not indulge
in immoderate desires for this kind of drink, and that they may derive
only what is honourable and useful from it." And Philochorus, in the
second book of his Atthis, says&mdash;"And a law was made at that time,
that after the solid food is removed, a taste of the unmixed wine
should be served round as a sort of sample of the power of the Good
Deity, but that all the rest of the wine should be previously mixed; on
which account the Nymphs had the name given them of Nurses of Bacchus."
And that when the pledge-cup to the Good Deity was handed round, it was
customary to remove the tables, is made plain by the wicked action of
Dionysius the tyrant of Sicily. For there was a table of gold placed
before the statue of Æsculapius at Syracuse; and so Dionysius, standing
before it, and chinking a pledge-cup to the Good Deity, ordered the
table to be removed.</p>

<p>But among the Greeks, those who sacrifice to the Sun, as Phylarchus
tells us in the twelfth book of his History, make their libations of
honey, as they never bring wine to the altars of the gods; saying that
it is proper that the god who keeps the whole universe in order, and
regulates everything, and is always going round and superintending the
whole, should in no respect be connected with drunkenness.</p>

<p>49. Most writers have mentioned the Attic Scolia; and they are worthy
also of being mentioned by me to you, on account of the antiquity and
simple style of composition of the authors, and of those especially who
gained a high reputation for that description of poetry, Alcæus and
Anacreon; as Aristophanes says in his Daitaleis, where we find this
line&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">SCOLIA.</div>

<p>Praxilla, the Sicyonian poetess, was also celebrated for the
composition of scolia. Now they are called scolia, not because of
the character of the verse in which they are written, as if it were
σκολιὸς (crooked); for men call also

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1109]</span>

those poems written in a laxer kind of metre σκολιά. But, "as there
are three kinds of songs" (as Artemo of Cassandra says in the second
book of his treatise on the Use of Books), "one or other of which
comprehends everything which is sung at banquets; the first kind is
that which it was usual for the whole party to sing; the second is that
which the whole party indeed sang, not, however, together, but going
round according to some kind of succession; the third is that which is
ranked lowest of all, which was not sung by all the guests, but only by
those who seemed to understand what was to be done, wherever they might
happen to be sitting; on which account, as having some irregularity
in it beyond what the other kinds had, in not being sung by all the
guests, either together or in any definite kind of succession, but
just as it might happen, it was called σκολιόν. And songs of this kind
were sung when the ordinary songs, and those in which every one was
bound to join, had come to an end. For then they invited all the more
intelligent of the guests to sing some song worth listening to. And
what they thought worth listening to were such songs as contained some
exhortations and sentiments which seemed useful for the purposes of
life."</p>

<p>51. After this, Democritus said;&mdash;But the song which was composed by
that most learned writer, Aristotle, and addressed to Hermias<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
of Atarneus, is not a pæan, as was asserted by Demophilus, who
instituted a prosecution against the philosopher, on the ground of
impiety (having been suborned to act

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1113]</span>

the part of accuser by Eurymedon, who was ashamed to appear himself
in the business). And he rested the charge of impiety on the fact of
his having been accustomed to sing at banquets a pæan addressed to
Hermias. But that this song has no characteristic whatever of a pæan,
but is a species of scolium, I will show you plainly from its own
language&mdash;</p>

<p>Nor has the song the burden, which all pæans have, of Io Pæan, as that
song written on Lysander the Spartan, which really is a pæan, has; a
song which Duris, in his book entitled The Annals of the Samians, says
is sung in Samos. That also was a pæan which was written in honour of
Craterus the Macedonian, of which Alexinus the logician was the author,
as Hermippus the pupil of Callimachus says in the first book of his
Essay on Aristotle. And this song is sung at Delphi, with a boy playing
the lyre as an accompaniment

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1114]</span>

to it. The song, too, addressed to Agemon of Corinth, the father
of Alcyone, which the Corinthians sang, contains the burden of the
pæan. And this burden, too, is even added by Polemo Periegetes to
his letter addressed to Aranthius. The song also which the Rhodians
sing, addressed to Ptolemy the first king of Egypt, is a pæan: for it
contains the burden Io Pæan, as Georgus tells us in his essay on the
Sacrifices at Rhodes. And Philochorus says that the Athenians sing
pæans in honour of Antigonus and Demetrius, which were composed by
Hermippus of Cyzicus, on an occasion when a great many poets had a
contest as to which could compose the finest pæan, and the victory was
adjudged to Hermippus. And, indeed, Aristotle himself, in his Defence
of himself from this accusation of impiety, (unless the speech is a
spurious one,) says&mdash;"For if I had wished to offer sacrifice to
Hermias as an immortal being, I should never have built him a tomb as a
mortal; nor if I had wished to make him out to be a god, should I have
honoured him with funeral obsequies like a man."</p>

<p>53. When Democritus had said this, Cynulcus said;&mdash;Why do you remind
me of those cyclic poems, to use the words of your friend Philo, when
you never ought to say anything serious or important in the presence of
this glutton Ulpian? For he prefers lascivious songs to dignified ones;
such, for instance, as those which are called Locrian songs, which are
of a debauched sort of character, such as&mdash;</p>

<p>And all Phœnicia is full of songs of this kind; and he himself, when
there, used to go about playing on the flute with the men who sing
colabri.<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
And there is good authority, Ulpian, for this word κόλαβροι. For
Demetrius the Scepsian, in the tenth book of his Trojan Array, speaks
thus:&mdash;"Ctesiphon the Athenian, who was a composer of the songs
called κόλαβροι, was made by Attalus, who succeeded Philetærus as king
of Pergamus, judge of all his subjects in the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1115]</span>

Æolian district." And the same writer, in the nineteenth book of the
same work, says that Seleucus the composer of merry songs was the son
of Mnesiptolemus, who was an historian, and who had great interest with
that Antiochus who was surnamed the Great. And it was very much the
fashion to sing this song of his&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>54. And after this, looking towards Ulpian, he said;&mdash;But since you are
out of humour with me, I will explain to you what the Syrbenæan chorus
is. And Ulpian said;&mdash;Do you think, you wretch, that I am angry at what
you say, or even that I pay the least attention to it, you shameless
hound? But since you profess to teach me something, I will make a truce
with you, not for thirty, but for a hundred years; only tell me what
the Syrbenæan chorus is. Then, said he, Clearchus, my good friend,
in the second book of his treatise on Education, writes thus&mdash;"There
remains the Syrbenæan chorus, in which every one is bound to sing
whatever he pleases, without paying the least attention to the man who
sits in the post of honour and leads the chorus. And indeed he is only
a more noisy spectator." And in the words of Matron the parodist&mdash;</p>

while the truce between us lasts.</p>

<p>55. And Cynulcus said;&mdash;There have been many poets who have applied
themselves to the composition of parodies, my good friend; of whom the
most celebrated was Eubœus of Paros, who lived in the time of Philip;
and he is the man who attacked the Athenians a great deal. And four
books of his Parodies are preserved. And Timon also mentions him, in

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1116]</span>

the first book of his Silli. But Polemo, in the twelfth book of his
Argument against Timæus, speaking of the men who have written parodies,
writes thus&mdash;"And I should call Bœotus and Eubœus, who wrote parodies,
men of great reputation, on account of their cleverness in sportive
composition, and I consider that they surpass those ancient poets whose
followers they were. Now, the invention of this kind of poetry we must
attribute to Hipponax the Iambic poet. For he writes thus, in his
Hexameters,&mdash;</p>

<p>Epicharmus of Syracuse also uses the same kind of poetry, in a small
degree, in some of his plays; and so does Cratinus, a poet of the old
Comedy, in his Eunidæ, and so also does his contemporary, Hegemon of
Thasos, whom they used to call Lentil. For he writes thus&mdash;</p>

<p>56. "Hermippus also, the poet of the old Comedy, composed parodies.
But the first writer of this kind who ever descended into the arena of
theatrical contests was Hegemon, and he gained the prize at Athens for
several parodies; and among them, for his Battle of the Giants. He also
wrote a comedy in the ancient fashion, which is called Philinna. Eubœus
also was a man who exhibited a good deal of wit in his poems; as, for
instance, speaking about the Battle of the Baths, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>57. After all this discussion had been entered into on many occasions,
once when evening overtook us, one of us said,&mdash;Boy, bring a light
(λύχνειον). But some one else used the word
λυχνεὼς, and a third called it λοφνίας, saying that that
was the proper name for a torch made of bark; another called it πανός; and another
φανός.&mdash;This one used the word
λυχνοῦχος, and that one λύχνος. Some one else again said
ἐλάνη, and another said ἕλαναι, insisting on it that
that was the proper name for a lamp, being derived from ἔλη,
brightness;

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1118]</span>

and urging that Neanthes used this word in the first book
of his History of Attalus. Others, again, of the party made use of
whatever other words they fancied; so that there was no ordinary
noise; while all were vying with one another in adducing every sort
of argument which bore upon the question. For one man said that
Silenus, the dictionary-maker, mentioned that the Athenians call lamps
φανοί. But Timachidas of Rhodes asserts that for
φανὸς, the word more properly used is δέλετρον, being a
sort of lantern which young men use when out at night, and which they
themselves call ἕλαναι. But Amerias for φανὸς
uses the word γράβιον. And this word is thus explained by
Seleucus:&mdash;"Γράβιον is a stick of ilex or common oak, which,

<p>he left the party, being very sleepy.</p>

<p>62. Then, when many of the guests cried out Io Pæan, Pontianus
said;&mdash;I wish, my friends, to learn from you whether Io Pæan is a
proverb, or the burden of a song, or what else it is. And Democritus
replied;&mdash;Clearchus the Solensian, inferior to none of the pupils of
the wise Aristotle, in the first book of his treatise on Proverbs,
says that "Latona, when she was taking Apollo and Diana from Chalcis
in Eubœa to Delphi, came to the cave which was called the cave of
the Python. And when the Python attacked them, Latona, holding one
of her children in her arms, got upon the stone which even now lies
at the foot of the brazen statue of Latona, which is dedicated as a
representation of what then took place near the Plane-tree at Delphi,
and cried out Ἵε, παῖ; (and Apollo happened to have
his bow in hand;) and this is the same as if she had said
Ἄφιε,Ἵε, παῖ, or Βάλε, παῖ, Shoot, boy.
And from this day Ἵε, παῖ and Ἵε, παιὼν
arose. But some people, slightly altering the word, use it as
a sort of proverbial exclamation to avert evils, and say ἰη παιὼν,
instead of Ἵε, παῖ. And many also, when they
have completed any undertaking, say, as a sort of proverb,
ἰὴ παιὼν; but since it is an expression that is familiar to us it is
forgotten that it is a proverb, and they who use it are not aware that
they are uttering a proverb."</p>

<p>But as for what Heraclides of Pontus says, that is clearly a mistake,
"That the god himself, while offering a libation, thrice cried out
ἱη παιὰν, ἵη παιών." From a belief in which statement
he refers the trimeter verse, as it is called, to the god, saying "that
each of these metres belongs to the god; because when the first two

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1122]</span>

syllables are made long, ἵη παιὰν, it becomes a heroic verse,
but when they are pronounced short it is an iambic, and thus it is
plain that we must attribute the iambic to him. And as the rest are
short, if any one makes the last two syllables of the verse long, that
makes a Hipponactean iambic.</p>

<p>63. And after this, when we also were about to leave the party, the
slaves came in bringing, one an incense burner, and another&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;. For it
was the custom for the guests to rise up and offer a libation, and then
to give the rest of the unmixed wine to the boy, who brought it to them
to drink.</p>

The Gymnopædiæ, or "Festival of naked Youths," was celebrated at Sparta
every year in honour of Apollo Pythæus, Diana, and Latona. And the
Spartan youths danced around the statues of these deities in the forum.
The festival seems to have been connected with the victory gained over
the Argives at Thyrea, and the Spartans who had fallen in the battle
were always praised in songs on the occasion.&mdash;V. Smith, Dict. Gr.

Phaselis is a town in Lycia. The land which worships Diana is the
country about Ephesus and Magnesia, which last town is built where
the Lethæus falls into the Mæander; and it appears that Diana was
worshipped by the women of this district under the name of Leucophrys,
from λευκὸς, white, and ὄφρυς, an eyebrow.</p>

Hermias was tyrant of Atarneus and Assos, having been originally the
minister of Eubulus, whom he succeeded. He entertained Aristotle at
his court for many years. As he endeavoured to maintain his kingdom in
independence of Persia, they sent Mentor against him, who decoyed him
to an interview by a promise of safe conduct, and then
seized him and sent him to Artaxerxes, by whom he was put to death.</p>

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 1173]</span>

    <div class="verse indent-3">And knowing all the usual sciences;</div>
    <div class="verse indent-3">Then the affair will seem quite different.</div>
    <div class="verse indent-3">We are the only three remaining ones&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent-3">Chariades, and Bœdion, and I.</div>

    <div class="verse indent-4"><i>Cook.</i> What, <i>I</i>?&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="verse indent-3">'Tis we that keep up Sicon's school,</div>
    <div class="verse indent-3">Who was the head and founder of the art.</div>
    <div class="verse indent-3">He used to teach us first of all astronomy;</div>
    <div class="verse indent-3">Next after that directly, architecture;</div>
    <div class="verse indent-3">Confining all he said to natural science.</div>
    <div class="verse indent-3">Then, to conclude, he lectured upon tactics.</div>
    <div class="verse indent-3">All this he made us learn before the art.</div>
    <div class="verse indent-4"><i>Gent.</i> Dear sir, d'ye mean to worry me to death?</div>
    <div class="verse indent-4"><i>Cook.</i> No; while the slave is coming back from market,</div>
    <div class="verse indent-3">I'll rouse your curiosity a little</div>
    <div class="verse indent-3">Upon the subject, that we thus may seize</div>
    <div class="verse indent-3">This most convenient time for conversation.</div>
    <div class="verse indent-4"><i>Gent.</i> By Phœbus, but you'll find it a hard matter!</div>
    <div class="verse indent-4"><i>Cook.</i> Listen, good sir. Firstly, the cook must know</div>
    <div class="verse indent-3">"Astronomy,"&mdash;the settings and the risings</div>
    <div class="verse indent-3">Of all the stars, and when the sun comes back</div>
    <div class="verse indent-3">Both to the longest and the shortest day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent-3">And through what constellations he is passing.</div>
    <div class="verse indent-3">For nearly every kind of meat and food</div>

    <div class="verse indent-3">And use each article just as he ought;</div>
    <div class="verse indent-3">But he that does not, will be justly thump'd.</div>
    <div class="verse indent-3">Again, perhaps, you wonder as to "architecture,"</div>

    <div class="verse indent-3">In every station and in every art;</div>

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
